<h1 id="thealgorithmforprecisionmedicine">The Algorithm for Precision Medicine</h1>

<p>The Algorithm for Precision Medicine is a plan to guide patients and their
caregivers on challenging diagnostic and therapeutic odysseys.</p>

<p>The Algorithm is an evolving distillation of my experience in diagnosing and
then identifying treatments for <a href="http://bertrand.might.net/">my son Bertrand</a>,
and then as <a href="http://matt.might.net/">Director of the Hugh Kaul
Precision Medicine Institute at UAB</a>, where I&#8217;ve been focused on developing
strategies and infrastructure to identify treatments for the patients that
reach out.</p>

<p>Bertrand passed away unexpectedly on October 23rd 2020, so I&#8217;m maintaining this
guide on <a href="http://bertrand.might.net/">his site</a> to keep his <a href="http://bertrand.might.net/#life">legacy</a> of science
in the service of patients alive.</p>

<p>If you find this guide helpful, I encourage you to give to the <a href="http://bertrand.might.net/#hopefund">Bertrand Might
Endowment for Hope at UAB</a>, a permanent
endowment whose interest each year goes toward science in the service of
diagnosis and treatment of patients like Bertrand.</p>

<p>As it stands, this document is very much an evolving draft.</p>

<p>I released it as a draft publicly on what would have been Bertrand&#8217;s 13th
birthday because I felt it already had plenty of value for anyone in a similar
situation to where I once was.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m keeping it posted even as a draft and updating it regularly because I don&#8217;t
want the perfect to become the enemy of the good (enough).</p>

<p>Honestly, I haven&#8217;t had time to fully update it with respect to all of the
advances in my understanding and all of the advances in science and medicine
since then.</p>

<p>But, everything I learned at least has a place-holder in this document now.</p>

<p><a href="http://matt.might.net/">Feedback on how to improve this document</a> is most
welcome, as there will be substantial additions, structural re-organization,
clean-up and revision.</p>

<p>In a real sense, this document will never be finished, so please check back.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p><a href="#define-precision-medicine">Precision medicine</a> focuses on the use of data (often large molecular data sets)
to precisely identify and address the root cause of disease in a patient.</p>

<p>The term <em>algorithm</em> in this case borrows from the notion of a step-by-step process in computer science.</p>

<p>As presented, The Algorithm for Precision Medicine is meant for patients with
presumed or diagnosed rare genetic disorders.</p>

<p>At a very high level, the Algorithm has two phases:</p>

<ol>
<li> Identify the molecular cause(s) of a patient&#8217;s disease.</li>
<li> Identify treatments for the molecular cause(s) of a patient&#8217;s disease.</li>
</ol>

<p>While the Algorithm as presented is tailored to rare genetic disorders, it
generalizable to help with more common or complex conditions (such as cancers)
where more than one gene or biological process is involved.</p>

<p><a name="audience"></a></p>

<h2 id="audienceandpurpose">Audience and purpose</h2>

<p>This is a living document that will be updated indefinitely.</p>

<p>It is meant for patients or caregivers that need to go beyond what medicine has
to offer in terms of finding treatments.</p>

<p>The language in this guide is targeted at early-stage undergraduates in
biomedical sciences with some but perhaps not extensive training in biology.</p>

<p>Given that most patients or families have no such training, there is a
comprehensive <a href="#qa">Q&amp;A</a> meant to bring patients and their families up to speed
on the relevant terms and concepts. In fact, non-biologists may benefit from
reading the entire <a href="#qa">Q&amp;A</a> first.</p>

<p>Terms that may not be familiar to readers are often linked to their entry in
the <a href="#qa">Q&amp;A</a>. You may want to open these up in a new tab as you read.</p>

<p>To make the guide more accessible, I have sometimes used terms more intuitive
to a lay audience (such as <em>mutation</em>) at first instead of the more precise
term often used by professionals (such as <em>variant</em> or <em>allele</em>).</p>

<p>Most probably don&#8217;t need to read this document in its entirety. For
example, if you already have a genetic diagnosis, there&#8217;s no need to read the
material on obtaining a diagnosis.</p>

<p>A second goal of this document is to provide undergraduates in
biomedical sciences the information they need to serve as guides for patients
and families navigating diagnostic or therapeutic odysseys.</p>

<p>More specifically, the Algorithm seeks to identify the set of available next
step(s) a patient could take, whether clinical or scientific, <em>en route</em> to
either a diagnosis or a therapy.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already trained in a (non-biomedical) technical field, then I

<h2 id="precisionmedicineinanutshell">Precision medicine in a nutshell</h2>

<p>This section provides a very high-level summary of the entire Algorithm for
Precision Medicine.</p>

<p>The first phase of the Algorithm for Precision Medicine is the diagnostic phase
&#8211; <a href="#process-obtaining-genetic-diagnosis">the identification of the (ideally root) molecular cause(s) of a
disease</a>.</p>

<p>In rare genetic disorders, the root molecular cause is usually a mutation in
a gene or two mutations in the same gene.</p>

<p>The second phase of the algorithm is the therapeutic phase: in which knowledge
of the molecular cause(s) of a patient&#8217;s disease enables the discovery of
therapies.</p>

<p>At a high level, the therapeutic phase of the algorithm for precision medicine
has two (and not mutually exclusive) internal algorithms: a rational
algorithm and an empirical algorithm.</p>

<p>The rational algorithm attempts to <em>predict</em> or <em>design</em> a treatment (often
computationally) based on a root <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism of harm</a>.</p>

<p>The empirical algorithm attempts to find a treatment through experimentation
such as drug screening.</p>

<p>In practice, these two branches will interleave with each other, as the
rational approach may lead to a question best answered experimentally or an
experiment may enable a new rational prediction about therapies.</p>

<p>The rational can also serve as a filter for the empirical: instead of testing
all existing drugs empirically, only drugs predicted to work under with the rational
algorithm can then be tested empirically for validation.</p>

<h3 id="summary:therationalalgorithmforprecisiontherapeutics">Summary: The Rational Algorithm for Precision Therapeutics</h3>

<p>The <a href="#process-identifying-therapeutics-rationally">Rational Algorithm for Precision Therapeutics</a> proceeds from the root
molecular cause(s) of the disease toward rational predictions of how to reverse
those causes, and it has two major phases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> For each <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism of harm</a>, <a href="#process-analyzing-impact">determine the impact on that mechanism</a>, that is, whether it results in:</p>

<ul>
<li> overactivity;</li>
<li> underactivity;</li>
<li> absence of activity; or</li>
<li> introduction of toxicity</li>
</ul>

<p>for each biological process involved.</p></li>
<li><p> Reverse the impact on those mechanisms of harm, which may involve:</p>

<ul>
<li> decreasing activity;</li>
<li> increasing activity;</li>
<li> compensating for or replacing the absence of activity; or</li>
<li> elimination of toxic activity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Within the rational algorithm, there are also some strategies that only apply
to specific types of genetic defects or specific classes of proteins &#8211; for
example, <a href="#readthrough-therapeutics">readthrough compounds for premature stop
mutations</a>.</p>

<p>The class of therapies considered under this rational approach include both
small molecules and gene-based therapies.</p>

<p>Gene-based therapies include replacing a missing gene (gene therapy or
biologics); fixing a broken gene (gene editing); or dynamically altering a
broken gene (such as with antisense oligonucleotides).</p>

<p>As a word of caution, of the gene-based approaches, only antisense
oligonucleotides are approaching tractability at the level of single patients
at present.</p>

<h3 id="summary:theempiricalalgorithmforprecisiontherapeutics">Summary: The Empirical Algorithm for Precision Therapeutics</h3>

<p>The empirical algorithm for precision medicine attempts to
identify both drugs and drug targets with experimentation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Create a <a href="#precision-disease-model">precision disease model</a> that represent a patient&#8217;s disease.</p></li>
<li><p> Phenotype the precision disease model.</p></li>
<li><p> Screen potential therapies against the disease model.</p></li>
<li><p> If no potential therapies are identified, then run experiments to
identify drug <em>targets</em>, and then feed these drug targets back into the
high-level Algorithm for Precision Medicine to find potential therapies.</p></li>
<li><p> Adapt potential therapies identified via the model to human beings.</p></li>

<h2 id="keylearnings">Key learnings</h2>

<p>If you want to skip reading the rest of the document, here are the key
learnings from my experience when it comes to precision medicine:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Once it &#8216;seems genetic,&#8217; conduct exome or genome sequencing.</strong> Don&#8217;t
waste time with gene panels and gene tests during the diagnostic odyssey.</li>
</ol>

<p><!-- TODO Add caveat about panels that can find repeat expansion disorders. --></p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Don&#8217;t stop at a &#8216;negative&#8217; result with sequencing.</strong> If sequencing
doesn&#8217;t find an answer, have the sequencing data evaluated by other teams and
at regular intervals over time as the literature advances understanding.
Plenty of patients get a diagnosis from a different team or at a later date
from the same data. When genomic sequencing fails, ask if transcriptomic
sequencing may help.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Your geneticist may not be the best scientist to work on your
condition.</strong> I was lucky that the geneticists that discovered my son&#8217;s
disease told me that they were not the right scientists to carry forward
research on the disease, and instead routed me to a glycobiologist that
could. After the diagnosis, the key next step is to identify the best
scientist for the relevant biology. I&#8217;ve seen an alarming number of families
fund research for the geneticist that diagnosed their child. To be blunt,
with rare and notable exceptions, once the geneticist has made the diagnosis,
their work toward identifying a treatment is done.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Build community <em>and</em> collegiality.</strong> It&#8217;s really hard to do this alone,
so you&#8217;ll want as many other patients with you as you can get. But beware the
systemic divisiveness that sets in within even the smallest rare disease
communities. I&#8217;ve seen disease after disease where warring factions in the
community end up becoming more focused on who will get credit for a cure that
never comes than actually finding the cure. This internecine warfare is
measured in the bodies of dead patients whose lives were cut short by
hamstrung science. Commit to openness and collaboration, even if you&#8217;re the
only one that does. In the end, it doesn&#8217;t matter who finds the cure &#8211;
only that it is found.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>You don&#8217;t have to understand a disease to find a treatment for it.</strong>
Most drugs are identified by creating a model of the disease and then testing
lots of drugs against the model, so a perfectly reasonable strategy is to build a
model, and then screen on it; then build another one and screen again. It is
possible go all the way to a drug in humans without knowing exactly why it
works.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Invest more in the translational over the basic.</strong> Building on the last
point, while there is always a chance that basic science could leap from
understanding to treatment, this is rarely the case. Focus on the end point:
finding a treatment, and work backward through what is necessary to do that.
Basic science may not be on the path at all. From a portfolio-balancing
perspective, 80% translational research and 20% basic research is probably
about the right mixture.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Repurposing an exsisting drug is the most realistic option for most
patients.</strong> Developing novel therapies is time-consuming and costly. Finding
an existing drug that ameliorates aspects of the condition is probably going
to be the most time- and cost-effective approach. Many become enamored with
gene therapy at first, only to find that the path toward seeing it in a human
being is too long and too costly to help in time.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Cells, fish, flies and mice are not people.</strong> Just because something
works in cells in a dish or in a model doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s going to work well
or work safely in a human. (That said, these models are still highly
effective and efficient routes to finding treatments.). There may be a long
process of medicinal chemistry to take something from the bench to the
bedside. Getting a compound that works to all the right tissues at the right
(and safe) concentrations is a major challenge. They key questions once a
drug &#8220;works&#8221; on cells or mice are: (0) What is the anticipated dose? (1) Does
the drug work at a concentration that corresponds to safe dosing in humans?
(2) Will the drug reach the right places, e.g., the brain? (3) How long would
the drug remain at active concentrations in the body for the anticipated
dose? (4) What safety issues come with long-term use of the drug at the
anticipated dose?</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Better is good enough.</strong> Many patients and parents assume that only a
cure is acceptable, and while a cure is absolutely worth aiming for and the
goal of this document, you may still find that if you fall short and &#8220;merely&#8221;
improve quality of life for the patient, that being <em>better</em> (if not <em>cured</em>)
is actually a substantial improvement in the quality of life for the
caregiver.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Regulatory hurdles may be greater than scientific ones.</strong>
All patients need to advocate with their legislators to mandate that
regulators provide broader regulatory flexbility for rare and life-threatening illnesses.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Spend time with your child.</strong> If you&#8217;re a parent or grandparent intent
on racing toward the cure or treatment for a child, please remember to also
spend as much time with them as you can. This is a difficult journey and
while hope is always appropriate, and while science always delivers in the
long run, it may not deliver on time. Balance the time on the quest for
treatment against the value of the time you may never get back.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="followingthealgorithmforprecisionmedicine">Following The Algorithm for Precision Medicine</h2>

<p>The Algorithm for Precision Medicine is best understood as a collection of
individual processes that are connected together.</p>

<p>In some cases, one process requires another.</p>

<p>In others, one process leads to another.</p>

<p>Some of these processes are useful for the diagnostic phase (e.g. analyzing
genetics); some are useful for the therapeutic phase (e.g. conducting drug
screens); some are useful for both phases (e.g. building model organisms).</p>

<p>The entry point into the Algorithm is obtaining a molecular (e.g. genetic)
diagnosis, and there is a <a href="#process-obtaining-genetic-diagnosis">process defined for obtaining a genetic
diagnosis</a>.</p>

<p>After the molecular diagnosis is made, the Algorithm shifts to the <a href="#process-identifying-precision-therapeutics">process for
finding precision therapeutics</a>.</p>

<h2 id="process:obtainingageneticdiagnosis">Process: Obtaining a genetic diagnosis</h2>

<p><a href="#exome">Exome</a> and <a href="#genome">genome</a>&nbsp;<a href="#sequencing">sequencing</a> are powerful techniques for
diagnosing <a href="#genetic-disorder">conditions with a suspected genetic cause</a>.</p>

<p>For these conditions, sequencing has the advantage of being able to look at
all genes simultaneously.</p>

<p>For many patients on diagnostic odysseys, sequencing is their only hope of
ending them.</p>

<p>Genetic panels, which look at a subset of all genes, and chromosomal analyses,
which look at higher-level abnormalities in chromosomal structure (such as
deletions, duplications and re-arrangements), may also be used.</p>

<p>Sequencing can find genetic changes, or <a href="#mutation">mutations</a>, of interest.
(Geneticists often use the closely related word <em>variant</em> to describe a
specific genetic change or mutation.)</p>

<p>For patients that have been on intractable diagnostic odysseys, the NIH-funded
<a href="http://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/">Undiagnosed Diseases Network</a> specializes in using advanced precision medicine
to deliver diagnoses. In Alabama, patients can apply for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/medicine/genetics/patient-care/clinical-services/undiagnosed-diseases">Undiagnosed Diseases Program</a> at UAB.</p>

<p>After genetic analysis, an important next step to <a href="#variant-interpretation">interpret the meaning of the
mutations</a> discovered.</p>

<h3 id="nextstepsifthereisnodiagnosis">Next steps if there is no diagnosis</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, genetic analysis does not always lead to a diagnosis.</p>

<p>In some cases, there are multiple plausible candidate mutations, but none can
be definitively linked to the condition, and in others, no
plausible candidate mutations are found.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> If plausible but not definitive candidates emerge among the mutations,
then the next steps are to determining which approaches were used to
analyze <a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a>, and attempting those which were not, which may
include techniques less common in a clinical setting, including:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="#process-analyzing-protein-structure">structural analysis</a> of the protein;</li>
<li> <a href="#functional-studies-mutations">conducting functional studies</a>; and</li>
<li> <a href="#finding-patients">finding additional patients</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> If no plausible candidates are identified, then next steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li> to use <a href="#genome">genome</a> sequencing if <a href="#exome">exome</a> sequencing was used;</li>
<li> to consider <a href="#somatic-mosaicism">somatic mosaicism</a> and other potentially confounding factors;</li>
<li> to pursue other &#8220;omics&#8221; beyond genomics, including <a href="#transcriptomics">transcriptomics</a> and <a href="#proteomics">proteomics</a>; and</li>
<li> to consider whether there are epigenetic modifications that could be driving disease.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> While unconventional, <a href="#crowd-sourcing">crowd-sourcing</a> the interpretation
of a mutation or genotype over social media (such as in a blog post), may
yield insight.</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO: #crowd-sourcing -->

<p><a name="process-analyzing-impact"></a>
<a name="variant-interpretation"></a>
<a name="mutation-analysis"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:interpretinggeneticfindings">Process: Interpreting genetic findings</h2>

<p>At the conclusion of a genetic analysis, a patient may have a diagnostic report
that contains several <a href="#mutation">mutations</a> identified. (Reports usually call
mutations <em>variants</em>.)</p>

<p>The report may label these according to their
<a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a> as:</p>

<ul>
<li> benign,</li>
<li> likely benign,</li>
<li> uncertain significance,</li>
<li> likely pathogenic, or</li>
<li> pathogenic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since every human being has many <a href="#mutation">mutations</a> within their genome,
merely finding mutations in a patient&#8217;s genome is not grounds for concluding
that those mutations are the cause of a <a href="#genetic-disorder">condition</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, most mutations are benign on their own &#8211; or not disease-causing if
only one allele is affected &#8211; so it is important to consider combinations of
mutations as well.</p>

<p>Each mutation (or the <a href="#genotype">genotype</a> collectively) must be interpreted
to determine whether or not it could plausibly contribute to the
<a href="#phenotype">phenotype</a> of the patient.</p>

<h3 id="typesofinterpretation:pathogenicityandimpact">Types of interpretation: Pathogenicity and impact</h3>

<p>When the interpretation of a genotype is meant to determine whether it is
disease-causing or not, it is referred to as interpretation of <a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a>.</p>

<p>Determining pathogenicity is key to obtaining a diagnosis.</p>

<!-- TODO: Q&A on pathogenicity -->

<p>A <em>deeper</em> interpretation of a genotype &#8211; functional impact analysis &#8211; tries
to figure out how the genotype alters the function of the affected gene, which
can be broadly one of four possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li> gain of function / overactivity, in which activity increases;</li>
<li> partial loss of function / underactivity, in which activity decreases;</li>
<li> total loss of function / absence, in which function is lost (or almost entirely lost); or</li>
<li> toxification, in which the mutant gene product is actively toxic when present.</li>
</ul>

<p>Impact analysis is crucial <em>after</em> pathogenicity has been determined on
the road to finding a therapy, as it is the basis for the <a href="#process-identifying-therapeutics-rationally">Rational Algorithm for Precision Therapeutics</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, impact analysis maybe necessary to support a
determination of pathogenicity: finding that a mutation significantly alters
the function of a gene raises the likelihood that it is pathogenic.</p>

<h3 id="methodsforinterpretationofpathogenicityandorimpact">Methods for interpretation of pathogenicity and/or impact</h3>

<p>While there are some principles that can aid in interpreting the pathogenicity
and/or impact of mutations, it is a challenging task, and while there are
techniques to aid, there is not a universal process guaranteed to reach a
conclusion.</p>

<p>Achieving consistent interpretations of genotypes is a
significant challenge at present.</p>

<p>For pathogenicity, the <a href="http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v17/n5/full/gim201530a.html">ACMG variant analysis guidelines</a> provide a baseline
set of techniques and resources to use during the interpretation of variants.</p>

<p>Less conventional resources, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, should also be
searched in case clinicians, researchers or even patients themselves have
posted relevant information online about a gene or variant.</p>

<p>When searching less structured resources, it is important to consider all
names for a gene (in both humans and other organisms).</p>

<p>For example, the equivalent of the gene NGLY1 is called PNGase in other
organisms (and more recently is sometimes erroneously called CDGIV or CDG1V).</p>

<p>If one specific variant is strongly suspected to be pathogenic, putting up a
website / social media page for the gene and the variant may attract other
patients looking for information on that gene because it has showed up in a

<p>If more than one relative is impacted (such as two siblings), combining
genotypic and phenotypic data from multiple relatives &#8211; both healthy and
affected &#8211; can aid in determining the pathogenicity of a mutation and the
<a href="#pattern-of-inheritance">pattern of inheritance</a> of a condition.</p>

<p>If a condition is <a href="#dominant">dominant</a>, then relatives with a causative pathogenic allele
should present with the condition. The caveat is that not all pathogenic
alleles are fully <a href="#penetrance">penetrant</a>, meaning that sometimes, people with pathogenic
alleles don&#8217;t present with a condition.</p>

<p>If a condition is <a href="#recessive">autosomal recessive</a>, then only relatives with two
causative pathogenic alleles should present with the condition.</p>

<p>Reasoning backward, potential patterns of inheritance also provide grounds
for additional scrutiny. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Because of their rarity, cases where both <a href="#variant">alleles</a> of an <a href="#autosome">autosomal</a>
gene harbor an apparent loss of function mutation (either in <a href="#compound-heterozygous">compound
heterozygous</a> form or <a href="#zygosity">homozygous</a> form) should raise suspicion of a
possible <a href="#recessive">recessive</a> disorder.</p></li>
<li><p> If a mutation is <a href="#de-novo"><em>de novo</em></a> &#8211; meaning the mutation does not

<h3 id="aidinginterpretation:populationfrequency">Aiding interpretation: Population frequency</h3>

<p>The frequency of an allele in a genomic population database such as <a href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/">gnomad</a>
also hints at pathogenicity: pathogenic alleles tend to be rarer.</p>

<h3 id="aidinginterpretation:analyzingconservation">Aiding interpretation: Analyzing conservation</h3>

<p>Evolutionary conservation, examined using tools such as the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC genome

<p>For example, if a particular <a href="#amino-acid">amino acid</a> remains the same in versions of the
gene across species, it is an indication that natural selection is protecting
against change in that amino acid, and changes to such an amino acid are more
likely to be pathogenic.</p>

<p>Looking at genes that co-evolve with a gene of interest with <a href="http://csb.pitt.edu/erc_analysis/">ERC analysis</a> may
also yield clues as to the functional role of the gene.</p>

<h3 id="aidinginterpretation:predictingdamagetofunction">Aiding interpretation: Predicting damage to function</h3>

<p>Before getting into more fine-grained interpretation regarding functional

<h3 id="aidinginterpretation:predictingfunctionalimpactofagenotype">Aiding interpretation: Predicting functional impact of a genotype</h3>

<p>In predicting the functional impact of a genotype, the goal is to determine
whether the genotype results in:</p>

<ol>
<li> overactivity;</li>
<li> underactivity;</li>
<li> absence of activity; or</li>
<li> introduction of toxic activity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many <a href="#genetic-disorder">genetic disorders</a> can be lumped into one of four classes according to
their impact on the function of a gene: gain of function (overactivity);
partial loss of function (underactivity); total loss of function (absence of
activity); or introduction of dominant-negative toxicity (toxic activity).</p>

<p>A total loss of function often results when:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> both alleles for a gene in an <a href="#recessive">autosomal recessive</a> disorder are
 impacted by loss of function mutations;</p></li>
<li><p> the only allele in an <a href="#x-linked">X-linked</a> disorder is impacted by a loss of
 function mutation;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A partial loss of function often results one when one allele in a
<a href="#haplosufficient">haploinsufficient</a> gene suffers a loss of function mutation.</p>

<p>A gain of function results when a mutation causes an <em>increase</em> in activity.</p>

<p>Introduction of toxicity through a mutation can happen in several ways.</p>

<p>For example, if a protein is critical in complex or polymer formation, if one
allele is damaged, it can result damaged complexes and poylmers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also possible that a mutation can cause a protein to become
aggregation-prone, and the aggregates themselves could become harmful.</p>

<p>Determining the functional impact in the mechanism of harm enables application
of the <a href="#process-identifying-therapeutics-rationally">Rational Algorithm for Precision Therapeutics</a> as a next step.</p>

<h2 id="aidinginterpretation:examiningmutationtype">Aiding interpretation: Examining mutation type</h2>

<p>In same cases, the <em>type</em> of a mutation can directly predict the impact:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> A <a href="#premature-stop">premature stop mutation</a> usually leads to loss of function
for a <a href="#protein">protein</a> encoded by that <a href="#variant">allele</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> A <a href="#frameshift">frameshift mutation</a> usually lead to the loss of function for a
protein encoded by that <a href="#variant">allele</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> An <a href="#in-frame">in-frame mutation</a> or <a href="#missense">missense mutation</a> may not lead to loss of
function, but it deserves closer scrutiny if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> it is in a <a href="#domain">domain of function</a>; or</p></li>
<li><p> it is in a <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a> that impacts <a href="#post-translational-modification">post-translational modification</a>; or</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p> A <a href="#synonymous">synonymous mutation</a> should not impact <a href="#protein">protein</a> function, but it may
damage <a href="#splicing">RNA splicing</a>, and in rare cases, a synonymous mutation can alter
translational dynamics just enough to alter folding of a protein.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Given the location and type of the mutation, expertise in the structure of
the protein or the gene may yield insight into its potential impact.</p>

<h4 id="case:mutationsinafunctionaldomain">Case: Mutations in a functional domain</h4>

<p>Mutations within a <a href="#domain">domain of function</a> should be viewed with increased
suspicion, as these have a greater chance of disrupting the activity of the
protein.</p>

<p>Consult the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/">NCBI protein database</a> or for known domains for a protein.</p>

<p>A mutation (especially a <a href="#missense">missense mutation</a> or an <a href="#in-frame">in-frame mutation</a>) that
enables or disables <a href="#post-translational-modification">post-translational modifications</a> warrants greater
scrutiny for <a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a>.</p>

<p>There are a variety of tools for predicting <a href="http://www.expasy.org/proteomics/post-translational_modification">post-translational modification
sites</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the loss of a <a href="#define-phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> site that is used to inhibit
activity could lead to gain of function.</p>

<h4 id="case:mutationsimpactingpost-primarystructure">Case: Mutations impacting post-primary structure</h4>

<p>A mutation (especially a <a href="#missense">missense mutation</a> or an <a href="#in-frame">in-frame mutation</a>) that
could potentially modify the secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure of a

<p><a href="#process-analyzing-protein-structure">Analyzing protein structure</a> is a complex process

<h3 id="aidinginterpretation:functionalstudies">Aiding interpretation: Functional studies</h3>

<p>Functional studies of mutations in a laboratory may help determine

<p>Functional studies involve analysis of a <a href="#precision-disease-model">precision disease model</a> &#8211; cell
lines or even whole <a href="#process-creating-model-organisms">model organisms</a>, such as a
mouse, fly or worm &#8211; that represent the disease in an easier-to-study system.</p>

<p>A model organism or cell line (if not from the patient) can be genetically
modified to have a genotype similar or equivalent to the one under
investigation.</p>

<p>In practice, functional studies require <a href="#identifying-an-expert">identifying an expert</a> in the
<a href="#gene">gene</a> or related genes to design an experiment that would support or refute
<a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a> for the <a href="#genotype">genotype</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if a mouse bearing the mutation(s) (or equivalent) presents with a
<a href="#phenotype">phenotype</a> corresponding to the patient, then this is supporting evidence of
<a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a>.</p>

<p>For interpretation, the <a href="http://monarchinitiative.org/">Monarch Initiative</a> can compare phenotypes across
species.</p>

<p>If studying cell lines with an <a href="#assay">assay</a> related to activity of the gene
reveals that the mutation has caused gain of function for the gene involved,
then the mutation should draw additional scrutiny.</p>

<p>If no <a href="#assay">assays</a> exist to examine the direct or indirect hypothesized
<a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanisms of harm</a>, it may be necessary to <a href="#discovering-assays">discover an

<p><a href="#identifying-an-expert">Identifying an expert</a> will be critical to any of these tasks.</p>

<h3 id="aidinginterpretation:specialcase:impactonatransporterprotein">Aiding interpretation: Special case: Impact on a transporter protein</h3>

<p>If a mechanism of harm for the disorder disrupts a <a href="#transporter-protein">transporter protein</a>
(such as an <a href="#ion-channel">ion channel</a>), the defect may increase, decrease or halt the
flow of a molecule across a membrane.</p>

<p>A damaging mutation in a transporter protein means the protein is
broken in some way. Since a membrane <a href="#transporter-protein">transporter protein</a> acts like an
automatic door, there are three ways that a door can suffer a &#8220;loss of
function&#8221;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> gain of conductance: a door that is stuck open lets in too much;</p></li>
<li><p> loss of conductance: a door that is stuck closed lets in too little; or</p></li>
<li><p> loss of selectivity: a door that now lets the wrong things in or out.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When dealing with a defect in a membrane transporter, is absolutely critical to
know whether the defect is causing a <em>gain</em> in traffic or a <em>loss</em> in traffic
&#8211; or a change in traffic.</p>

<p>In addition, defects related to the ligand in a ligand-gated transporter
protein offer the possibility of intervening at the level of the ligand
rather than the channel.</p>

<p>Cystic fibrosis &#8211; as a total loss of function (in the sense of closure) in a
chloride channel &#8211; is an example of a transporter protein defect with a recent
track record of success in finding treatments.</p>

<h3 id="interpretingchromosomalabnormalities">Interpreting chromosomal abnormalities</h3>

<p>High-resolution karyotyping and next-generation sequencing can also detect
chromosomal abnormalities.</p>

<p>Chromosomal abnormalities usually impact many genes simultaneously,
leading to duplicated copies of many genes or deleted copies of many
genes (or both).</p>

<p>The next step is to determine which genes have been impacted, and then to
attempt [molecular therapeutics] on a gene-by-gene basis.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC genome browser</a>, one can look up the genes found in the
affected regions.</p>

<p>A diagnostic report should indicate the specific abnormality:</p>

deleted.</p></li>
<li><p> In a chromosomal duplication, the set of genes in the fragment have
been duplicated.</p></li>
<li><p> In a chromosomal translocation, fragments of two chromosomes have

or unbalanced (indicating possible duplicated and lost genes).</p></li>

<p>A diagnostic report should also include the regions impacted in

<!-- TODO: Fold this into the analysis section? -->

<p>While it is critical to identify the root cause of a disease by <a href="#process-analyzing-impact">interpreting
genetic findings</a>, there may be benefit to continuing a basic scientific
investigation beyond variant interpretation or variant impact analysis.</p>

<p>Specifically, it is also useful (when feasible) to unearth the downstream
mechanisms of harm that emerge from this root cause.</p>

<p>For example, if a patient has seizures, the underlying genotype by itself may
not explain how this ultimately disrupts physiology enough to cause them.</p>

<p>Determining the <a href="#pathogenic">pathogenicity</a> of a mutation often does not involve causally
linking the underlying gene or variant to all of the high-level symptoms of the
patient. (For example, when a second case is identified to confirm the cause,
there may still be no knowledge as to <em>why</em> it is causal.)</p>

<p>It may be difficult to treat a disease if the <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">chain of
events</a> (starting with a mutation) that cause harm to the
patient are not understood: the root cause itself may be extremely challenge to
address therapeutically.</p>

<p>The <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">chain of causality</a> between a pathogenic genotype and
a high-level symptom may be lengthy, but each link in the chain offers yet
another opportunity to attempt the identification of therapeutics.</p>

<p>Targeting a later link in the chain is easier than targeting the initial cause,
with the expectation that focusing on downstream mechanisms may bring less
general relief.</p>

<p>Investigational studies can proceed bottom-up from the cell biology, or
they can move top-down from the natural history studies and model organisms.</p>

<p>Ideally, these studies should move in both directions and generate hypotheses
for the other to test.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, investigational studies like these are more basic than
translational science in nature, and so require careful partnership with basic
scientists with the appropriate expertise.</p>

<p><strong>It is critical to note that it is entirely possible in many cases to identify
a treatment without uncovering any links in the chain of causality between root
cause and symptom.</strong></p>

<p>If resources are constrained (as they usually are), there is likely more payoff
to proceeding directly to <a href="#process-identifying-precision-therapeutics">techniques to identify
therapies</a> than in basic
scientific studies.</p>

<p>A notable exception to this rule are <a href="#process-conducting-natural-history-studies">natural history
studies</a>, which while basic in
nature, may have significant value both scientifically and with regulators
toward the end of the therapeutic identification process, as studies proceed

<p>Most of these tasks will require <a href="#identifying-an-expert">identifying an expert</a>.</p>

<h2 id="process:analyzingproteinstructure">Process: Analyzing protein structure</h2>

<p>In the search for both a diagnosis and a therapy, it is sometimes useful to

<p>For example, <a href="#process-virtual-screening">computer modeling can look for drugs that interact with the 3D
structure of a protein</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, it is useful to see how the 3D structure of a protein has been

mutation can indicate how the behavior of the protein has changed (or not
changed).</p>

<p>For example, if a critical amino acid in the pore of an ion channel changes
from a negative side chain to a positive side chain, it could have a
significant impact on the ability of the appropriate ions to flow through the
channel.</p>

<p>Creating <a href="#model-organism">model organisms</a> &#8211; such as flies, mice, worms and yeast &#8211; can aid
<a href="#variant-interpretation">interpretation of variants</a> during diagnosis, in understanding the <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism
of harm</a>, in screening for potential drugs and in <a href="#validating-compounds">validating compounds</a>.</p>

<p>If a <a href="#model-organism">model organism</a> recapitulates the phenotype of a patient, then it is
evidence that the modeled genotype is pathogenic.</p>

<p>Even if a model organism does not share the same phenotype as human
patients, it may still be useful for scientific investigations, so long as
it has an observable phenotype.</p>

<p>If a <a href="#model-organism">model organism</a> responds to a therapy, then it can aid in <a href="#validating-compounds">validating
predicted therapeutics</a>.</p>

<p>The choice of <a href="#model-organism">model organism</a> in disease research is guided by the
exhibition of a strong phenotype for the disorder and/or its correspondence
with the human phenotype.</p>

<p>After the construction of a model organism, a critical next step is to
characterize the phenotype of the model.</p>

<p>For example, zebrafish can exhibit seizures, and checking for these is part of
the phenotyping process.</p>

<p>Characterizing the phenotype of a model organism may be significantly more
labor than creating the initial organism itself, but it is a critical step,
since it is difficult to test therapeutics without a robust phenotype.</p>

<p>Many academic laboratories and institutes such as <a href="http://www.jax.org/">Jackson Laboratories</a> can
construct and phenotype model organisms.</p>

<p>In the context of human disease, there are three categories of model organisms
commonly employed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <a href="#knockout">knockout</a> organisms in which a gene is removed;</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#knockdown">knock down</a> organisms in which a gene&#8217;s expression is reduced; and</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#knockin">knock-in</a> organisms in which an allele is added or replaced.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="process-identifying-precision-therapeutics"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:identifyingprecisiontherapeutics">Process: Identifying precision therapeutics</h2>

<p>With a <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism of harm</a> identified, it is possible to consider the
identification of therapeutics to target that mechanism.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are two approaches for identifying precision
therapeutics: <a href="#process-identifying-therapeutics-rationally">the rational approach</a>
and <a href="#process-identifying-therapeutics-empirically">the empirical approach</a>.</p>

<p>Both approaches may be pursued in parallel.</p>

<p>If resource constraints force them to be ordered, the rational approach may
work better for disorders in which the goal is to modulate a specific molecular
activity, while the empirical approach may work better when the root mechanism
of harm is an absence of activity or an introduced toxicity.</p>

<p>The empirical approach also eliminates the need to conduct variant impact
analysis, so if resolving the specific impact of a variant is going to be
time-consuming or costly, then the empirical approach may be a reasonable bypass.</p>

<p><a name="process-identifying-therapeutics-rationally"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:identifyingtherapeuticsrationallytherationalalgorithmforprecisiontherapeutics">Process: Identifying therapeutics rationally / The Rational Algorithm for Precision Therapeutics</h2>

<p>Rational identification of therapeutics involves <a href="#process-analyzing-impact">understanding the functional impact of
the mechanism of harm</a>, and then identifying
therapies that invert the impact.</p>

<p>These therapies include small molecules, but also more complex gene-based
strategies such as gene therapy, gene editing or antisense oligonucleotides.</p>

<p>Before the rational approach can begin, it is critical to understand the <em>impact</em>
associated with the mechanism of harm.</p>

<p>In general, for each mechanism of harm, there are four possible impacts on the
associated biological process, and four corresponding rational strategies to
identify therapies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Overactivity requiring inhibition: if a biological process has become overactive,
then it must be inhibited. <a href="#process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target">Jump to activating or inhibiting a target</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> Underactivity requiring activation: if a biological process has become underactive,
then it must be activated. <a href="#process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target">Jump to activating or inhibiting a target</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> Absence of activity requiring compensation: if a biological process has
become absent, then there must be compensation for the absence &#8211; up to and
including replacement of the missing activity. <a href="#process-compensating-for-absence-of-function">Jump to compensating for absence of function</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> Toxic activity requiring elimination: if a biological process has
introduced active toxicity, then it must be eliminated. <a href="#process-eliminating-toxic-activity">Jump to eliminating toxic activity</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While the initial genotype may itself be a target or suggest targets, it is also possible to <a href="#process-finding-therapies-with-transcriptomics">conduct
transcriptomics</a> to identify additional targets for input the rational approach.</p>

<p>It is also possible to consider rational strategies that target specific
aspects of the type of the gene involved, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="#process-developing-genotype-directed-therapies">targeting a genotype</a>;</li>
<li> targeting a receptor defect;</li>
<li> targeting gene regulatory defects;</li>
<li> targeting a structural protein defect;</li>
<li> targeting a non-coding RNA defect;</li>
<li> targeting a proteinopathy.</li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO: Move these to activating / inhibiting or to total loss Processes as appropriate -->

<h3 id="targetingareceptordefect">Targeting a receptor defect</h3>

<p>If a mechanism of harm impacts a <a href="#receptor">receptor</a>, then modulating the activity of
the receptor applies if the receptor is not gone, and there are additional
possibilities due to special properties of receptors.</p>

<p>Receptors are more complex in their interactions than enzymes, because
they have a baseline level of activity &#8211; <a href="#constitutive-activity">constitutive activity</a> &#8211; even
in the absence of the ligand (agonist) which stimulates them.</p>

<p>With a partial loss of function, a next step is look for <a href="#agonists">agonists</a> of the
receptor.</p>

<p>In the case of a gain of function, increasing <a href="#antagonists">antagonists</a> may help, but
increasing <a href="#inverse-agonists">inverse agonists</a> may help as well.</p>

<p>Receptors can also be viewed as the starting points of the metabolic
pathways that they kick off, so it may be easier to target a metabolic
pathway behind the receptor than the receptor
defect itself.</p>

<!-- TODO: Add targeting metabolic pathway link -->

<p>For any compound suggested by these strategies, the next step
is <a href="#validating-compounds">compound validation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="targetingakinasedefect">Targeting a kinase defect</h3>

<p>Kinases phosphorylate other proteins, which may either activate or inhibit them.</p>

<p>If the mechanism of harm involves altered activity in a kinase, then looking
into the downstream targets of the kinase (as the next links in the mechanisms
of harm) for modulation may be useful.</p>

<h3 id="targetinggeneregulatorydefects">Targeting gene regulatory defects</h3>

<p>Apart from a genetic disorder&#8217;s primary <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism of harm</a>, disregulation
of other genes can account for harm in these disorders as well.</p>

<p>Most genes have a role to play in the <a href="#gene-regulation">regulation of other
genes</a>: increasing expression expression of one gene may
increase or decrease the expression of another gene.</p>

<p>As a result, altering the expression of the protein impacted by a mutation
can have downstream effects through <a href="#gene-regulatory-network">gene regulatory networks</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, some genes &#8211; such as those involved in chromatin modification
or histone/DNA methylation &#8211; engage in regulation of other genes as their
primary function.</p>

<p>To target the primary effects of a mutation in a regulatory gene and the
downstream effects of other mutations,
<a href="#process-finding-therapies-with-transcriptomics">transcriptomics</a> and
<a href="#proteomics-therapeutics">proteomics</a> can reveal the extent to which other
genes have been disregulated, and can suggest therapeutic strategies
for restoring a baseline gene expression profile.</p>

<h3 id="targetingastructuralproteindefect">Targeting a structural protein defect</h3>

<p>If a mechanism of harm disrupts a protein whose primary purpose is
structural (as in dystrophin), then it is challenging to replace the
structure.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.parentprojectmd.org/">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy community</a> is an exemplar in developing
strategies for tackling the absence of a structural protein.</p>

<p>Given the pharmacological challenges in therapeutically delivering a
structural protein, strategies focusing on the mutation such as
<a href="#exon-skipping-therapeutics">exon-skipping</a>
and
<a href="#readthrough-therapeutics">readthrough</a> are next steps,
assuming the mutations are in scope.</p>

<p>Though difficult, investments in basic science for
<a href="#gene-therapeutics">gene-editing</a> may be advisable.</p>

<p>If it is suspected that the mutant protein would have some value, but
protein quality control mechanisms are too aggressively degrading the
protein, then a next step is to <a href="#finding-mutant-stabilizers">search for
stabilizers</a> for the mutant protein.</p>

<h3 id="targetinganon-codingrnadefect">Targeting a non-coding RNA defect</h3>

<p>If the primary cause of a disorder is an error (or a loss) of <a href="#non-coding-RNA">non-coding
RNA</a> &#8211; which is presumed to be rare relative to disorders caused by defects
in proteins &#8211; then there are two additional high-level strategies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> delivering the missing non-coding RNA; and</p></li>
<li><p> editing the defects in the non-coding region.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>RNA is straightforward to synthesize, but targeted delivery and retaining
bioavailability is a significant challenge in the <a href="#apply-medicinal-chemistry">application of medicinal
chemistry</a>.</p>

<p>However, <a href="#gene-therapeutics">targeted gene-editing</a> has additional (likely more difficult)
challenges.</p>

<h3 id="targetingaproteinopathy">Targeting a proteinopathy</h3>

<p>If a mechanism of harm disturbs <a href="#protein-folding">protein folding</a>, in some cases, the new
foldings (or foldings to which they have become susceptible), are
actively malignant.</p>

<p>In many cases, cells can detect misfolded and/or mutant proteins through
quality control mechanisms, and degrade them.</p>

<p>In some diseases, improper protein folding causes toxic protein aggregation.</p>

<p>For instance, amyloid misfolding features in diseases such as prion
disease, amyloidosis, Alzheimer&#8217;s, Huntington and Parkinson&#8217;s, as it
allows aggregation of misfolded proteins.</p>

<p>In disorders in which misfolding is driving malignant behavior, several
high-level strategies are in scope, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> identifying compounds that can stabilize the misfolded protein;</p></li>
<li><p> creating monoclonal <a href="#antibodies">antibodies</a> to target malignant proteins;</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target">activating chaperones that aid folding</a>; and</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target">activating processes that degrade misfolded proteins</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Heat shock proteins aid protein folding and are often naturally
upregulated when a cell is stressed (although heat shock therapeutics
have been challenging to develop due to toxicity).</p>

<p>Autophagy is the process by which cells digest defective or excessive
components, and upregulation of this process may be beneficial in
proteinopathies.</p>

<p>If protein aggregration specifically is problematic, then an additional
strategy is to characterize sites on the protein that allow aggregates
to form and to identify inhibitors that can interfere with these sites,
with the aim of preventing aggregates from forming.</p>

<!-- TODO: add section on monoclonal antibody development -->

<p>For any identified compound, the next step is <a href="#validating-compounds">compound validation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="targetingthephenotype">Targeting the phenotype</h3>

<p>It is possible to bypass the primary mechanisms and instead look for
therapeutics based on <a href="observable">biomarkers</a> and/or <a href="#phenotype">phenotypes</a> in cells and/or model
organisms.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> At the level of a patient, phenotypic targeting is simply symptomatic
treatment. For instance, if a symptom of the disorder is epilepsy, one
can try known anticonvulsants.</p></li>
<li><p> If <a href="#investigational-studies-mechanism">investigational studies</a> into the
mechanism of harm have found a phenotype in model organisms, then a
next step is <a href="#model-organism-screening">model-organism screening</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:inhibitingoractivatingatarget">Process: Inhibiting or activating a target</h2>

<p>In the course of identifying therapeutics, a specific gene may become a target
for inhibition or activation.</p>

<p>There are broadly two ways to lower the function of a gene by degree: (1) reducing
expression of the gene and (2) physically interfering with the activity of the
gene product via chemical inhibition.</p>

<p>For the first approach &#8211; moduling gene expression &#8211; <a href="#process-developing-aso">developing an antisense
oligonucleotide</a> is a self-contained approach that may
be pursued in parallel.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, there are broadly two ways to raise the function of a gene by
degree: increasing expression of the gene and (2) physically catalyzing or
increasing the activity of the gene product via chemical activation.</p>

<p>If the gene in question is an enzyme, increasing the concentration of the
precursors to the catalyzed reaction may make more efficient use of the
existing enzyme.</p>

<p>As a warning, if the gene remains fully functional even with low levels of the
protein present, then reducing gene expression may not be a practical strategy
for inhibition. This is common for enzymes, where even small amounts of
protein can be sufficient for &#8220;normal&#8221; function.</p>

<p>Computational approaches may help chemical identify strategies for activation
or inhibition including:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="#process-mining-biomedical-knowledge">Mining biomedical knowledge</a></li>
<li> <a href="#process-virtual-screening">Virtual drug screening</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, <a href="#process-screening-for-candidate-compounds">conducting chemical drug
screens</a> may also be in scope for
identifying inhibitors.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may not be possible to directly inhibit or activate a
specific target, but it may be possible to inhibite or activate a <em>regulatory
modulator</em> of that target.</p>

<p>For example, RHOBTB2 has no known direct inhibitors, but E2F1 regulates
RHOBTB2, and celecoxib can inhibit E2F1. Thus, celecoxib may be an indirect
inhibitor of RHOBTB2.</p>

<h3 id="specificstrategiesforreversingunderactivity">Specific strategies for reversing underactivity</h3>

<p>If there is diminished &#8211; but not lost &#8211; activity for a gene, then the
high-level strategy is to increase activity.</p>

<p>When there is residual activity, there are additional strategies to
be considered in addition to those for <a href="#total-loss-of-function-strategies">total loss of

<ul>

<h3 id="specificstrategiesforreversingoveractivity">Specific strategies for reversing overactivity</h3>

<p>If a disorder is caused by a gain of function in a gene or is aggravated
by activity in another gene, then a rational high-level strategy is to suppress
activity in that gene or in a relevant pathway.</p>

<p>If upstream or downstream elements in the affected pathways are known,
then applying the same gain of function strategies to each element in
the pathway may serve to counteract a gain of function upstream or
downstream.</p>

<p>If no inhibitor, blocker or antagonist is known, then <a href="#virtual-screening">structure-based

<p>It is also possible to consider the design of knock-down antisense

<p>There are three general strategies for correcting for the absence of function:</p>

<ol>
<li> restoring the lost function;</li>
<li> adapting to lost function; and</li>
<li> empirically screening for or testing potential rescues.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the difficulty compensating for lost function with rational approaches,
<a href="#process-identifying-therapeutics-empirically">empirical approaches to identifying

<p><a name="discovering-assays"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:identifyingassays">Process: Identifying assays</h2>

<p>For each <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism of harm</a>, investigational studies should aim to discover
laboratory assays that can observe the hypothesized or confirmed mechanism.</p>

<p>An assay is, effectively, a standardized laboratory experiment with a
well-defined readout for its result.</p>

<p>The purpose of an assay is to measure a specific feature of a biological
system.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Protein-expression assays measure the amount of a particular protein present
in a sample (usually with an <a href="#antibody">antibody</a>).</p></li>
<li><p> Enzymatic activity assays measure the level of activity or function present
for a particular enzyme.</p></li>
<li><p> Electrophysiological assays measure electrical properties of cells.
(Genetic epilepsies may benefit from this broad category of assay.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Having a suite of assays that can probe different links of the mechanism of
harm are critical for validating compounds predicted to have therapeutic
benefit.</p>

<p>For example, a good assay might fluoresce in the presence
of a compound that corrects some aspect of the mechanism of harm.</p>

<p>Assays are helpful for <a href="#validating-compounds">validating proposed
compounds</a>.</p>

<p>Precise assays are also a prerequisite for <a href="#process-conducting-high-throughput-screening">conducting high-throughput screening</a>.</p>

<p>There are roughly three kinds of assays, in order of increasing
complexity:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> cell-free assays isolate the key components of a cellular or chemical
process;</p></li>
<li><p> cell-based assays operate on patient cells or on cells that model the
disease; and</p></li>
<li><p> model-organism-based assays observe the phenotype of a model
organism.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lower-complexity assays tend to be more economical for <a href="#process-conducting-high-throughput-screening">conducting
high-throughput screening</a> techniques, while higher-complexity techniques tend
to produce stronger candidates. (For instance, if a compound works on a model
organism, at least some aspect of the delivery challenge in medicinal chemistry
has been solved.)</p>

<h3 id="awordofcautiononassaydevelopment">A word of caution on assay development</h3>

<p>Designing scientific experiments to measure a feature of interest is a
fundamentally creative process, so assay discovery is subject to the same
constraints that govern scientific progress itself.</p>

<p>Designing an assay will require <a href="#identifying-an-expert">finding an expert</a> in the relevant biology.</p>

<p>While it is hard to systematize or automate the process of assay

</ul>

<p>For each disorder, it is important to create the cell lines with the strongest
phenotype relative to the high-level phenotype of the patients. The strongest
phenotypes are most useful for validation and screening.</p>

<p>For instance, if a disorder has strong liver involvement, then hepatocytes may
provide a strong cellular representation of the disorder, while if it is
neurological in nature, then neurons may provide a strong representation.</p>

<p>As cell lines become established, it is important to conduct
<a href="#investigational-studies-mechanism">investigational studies</a> that
establish phenotypes for the different cell types.</p>

<h3 id="patient-derivedcelllines">Patient-derived cell lines</h3>

<p>The type of cell lines necessary for studying a disorder vary with the
disorder, but fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid lines are relatively common, if
only for their durability.</p>

<p>Stem cell lines (usually induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) made from
patients) can also be useful in studying a disorder, because they are
differentiable into other cell types, such as brain cells or liver cells.</p>

<p>Stem cell lines cost around USD 5,000 to USD 10,000 to create in an academic
laboratory, but can take months to create, so it is advisable to start the
process early. Differentiation into other cell types can take longer still.</p>

<p>It is also advisable to use as many patients as possible, since some
patients will inevitably provide more robust cell lines than others.</p>

<h3 id="constructedcelllines">Constructed cell lines</h3>

<p>Since some genetic conditions make culturing patient-derived cells challenging,
so an alternative approach is to introduce a patient&#8217;s pathogenic mutations
directly into an existing cell line.</p>

<p>For instance, cancer cell lines are sometimes used for their robust growth
properties, although cancer cell lines can alter the phenotype of the cells.</p>

<p>An advantage of using existing cell lines is that, in addition to growing well,
they can be created relatively quickly and cheaply for almost any tissue type.</p>

<p>The chief disadvantage is that their fidelity to the actual condition and real
patients may not be clear.</p>

<h2 id="process:establishingbiobanksandreagentrepositories">Process: Establishing biobanks and reagent repositories</h2>

<p>As a patient community grows, establishing biobanks with cell lines and
repositories of reagents can accelerate research and make it easier to compare
and reproduce results between research labs.</p>

<p>A set of reagents that will likely prove useful are antibodies to any
proteins of interest. (Antibodies can be used in a lab to detect the
presence of a particular protein.)</p>

<p>Patient communities will likely want to partner with an existing medical
research institute such as a university, the NIH or a non-profit such as
<a href="http://www.sbpdiscovery.org/">Sanford-Burnham-Prebys</a> or <a href="https://www.coriell.org/">Coriell</a> for biobanking of cell lines and
tissues.</p>

<p>Because patient tissue is extremely valuable, communities should also
consider creating a procedure for donating the bodies of deceased patients
to aid in investigation of the disorder, should patients or parents choose
to do so.</p>

<h2 id="process:findingmodifiergenesanddrugtargets">Process: Finding modifier genes and drug targets</h2>

<p>In addition to <a href="#investigational-studies-mechanism">identifying mechanisms of
harm</a>, pre-translational scientific
investigations can also aim to identify genes that modify the <a href="#phenotype">phenotype</a> of a
condition.</p>

<p>Some of these related genes may in turn become drug targets.</p>

<p><strong>This is an important insight: the gene that caused the disorder may not be
the gene that is targeted to correct the disorder.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, in a loss of function disorder, there may be another gene
that can compensate for the role of the lost activity.</p>

<p>If an <a href="#discovering-assays">assay that measures the activity of the deficient gene is
available</a>, then it is possible to conduct a <a href="#genetic-screen">genetic
screen for alternate pathways</a>.</p>

<p>If a compensatory gene is discovered, then the next step is to target it for
<a href="#process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target">activation</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, disabling or decreasing expression of a second gene may actually
suppress the <a href="#phenotype">phenotype</a> of the disorder. Suppressor genes offer additional
therapeutic targets for inhibition. A <a href="#genetic-screen">genetic screen</a> can identify suppressor
genes as well.</p>

<p>For general interactions between genes, the <a href="http://string-db.org/">STRING database</a> and <a href="http://www.genemania.org/">Genemania</a>
provide information on known relationships.</p>

<p>For determining which genes co-evolve together &#8211; which yields clues to
function &#8211; one can use <a href="http://csb.pitt.edu/erc_analysis/">ERC analysis</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to genetic screens, another broad-spectrum approach to identifying
targets (and sometimes therapies) is to <a href="#process-finding-therapies-with-transcriptomics">conduct transcriptome-oriented
experiments</a> that reveal genes
that have been highly disregulated.</p>

<p>Genes that have been significantly upregulated could be targets for inhibition,

<p>Gene therapy typically uses a repurposed and modified virus (such as AAV9) to
&#8220;infect&#8221; the host with a new gene that has been placed in side of it.</p>

<p>Gene editing delivers gene-editing material and programming, such as the Cas9
protein suitable RNA guides, to edit the mutant gene directly back to wild-type.</p>

<p>Both gene therapy and gene editing suffer from significant challenges.</p>

<p>Correcting every single cell in the body is a substantial pharmacological
challenge &#8211; since it requires reaching every cell. So, typically, some
meaningful subset of all cells must be hit &#8211; such as a specific organ or
tissue, and even this remains a major challenge.</p>

<p>In the case of gene editing, the error rate in the edits has to be low enough
that it doesn&#8217;t cause serious harm in the process.</p>

<p>The costs and timelines for <a href="#gene-therapeutics">pursing gene therapy or gene

<p>Gene editing and gene therapy is a theoretical silver bullet for all
genetic disorders, and with enough investment in basic scientific
research, it will almost certainly one day become reality.</p>

<p>Conceptually, gene editing involves editing out defects in an organism&#8217;s
genome by inserting, replacing or deleting elements in an organism&#8217;s
genetic code.</p>

<p>Practically, there are three major high-level challenges with most
approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Delivering the gene-editing agents to every cell (or every cell of
interest).</p></li>
<li><p> Ensuring that the editing error rate is low enough to avoid
introducing additional mutations (and likely cancer in the process).</p></li>
<li><p> Managing the immune response to delivery vectors.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For delivering gene-editing agents, engineered viruses are the most
popular platform.</p>

<p>New genetic material (such as a functioning gene version of a gene) can
be delivered directly as a separate fragment of DNA called a plasmid.</p>

<p>Alternatively, genetic material can be integrated into the host genome
via techniques like Zinc fingers, TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9 or meganucleases.</p>

<p>When the mutation of interest is a premature stop, then testing readthrough

<li><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G418">G418</a> is a potent readthrough

<p>ASOs can:</p>

<li><p> downregulate gene activity by decreasing gene expression with gene-based knockdown;</p></li>

<p><a name="exon-skipping-therapeutics"></a></p>

<h3 id="creatingexon-skippingantisenseoligonucleotides">Creating exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides</h3>

<p>If a damaging mutation occurs in an <a href="#exon">exon</a> that is non-critical
to the resulting protein, then exon-skipping may be a viable therapeutic
approach.</p>

<p>Databases such as the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl genome browser</a> can provide the exons and
introns for a gene.</p>

<p>In addition, Ensembl will also provide alternate transcripts that have
been identified. If an alternate transcript exists that skips the exon
containing the mutation, this is a positive (though not essential)
indication that exon-skipping is a viable therapeutic approach.</p>

<p>To skip over a mutation-bearing exon, an <a href="#antisense-oligonucleotide">antisense
oligonucleotide</a> is created that can induce RNA
splicing to skip that exon during construction of mRNA.</p>

<p>In theory, an antisense oligonucleotide sequence could be customized for
any disorder in which it is reasonable to skip an exon.</p>

<p>Exon-skipping was a theoretical possibility when I first started writing this
article in 2015, but it became an FDA-approved and even single-patient modality
not long thereafter.</p>

<h3 id="upregulatinggeneexpressionwithantisenseoligonucleotides">Upregulating gene expression with antisense oligonucleotides</h3>

<p>If the activity of a gene needs to be enhanced and there is at least one

introns, thereby increasing the efficiency of conversion from pre-mRNA to mRNA
are in scope.</p>

<h3 id="downregulatinggeneoralleleexpressionwithantisenseoligonucleotides">Downregulating gene or allele expression with antisense oligonucleotides</h3>

<p>If the activity of a gene needs to decreased, then knockdown ASOs &#8211; which may
be specific to a single allele or the entire gene &#8211; can be developed.</p>

<p>If a single mutant allele has introduced toxicity, then an allele-specific ASO
is a reasonable strategy to consider for eliminating that toxicity.</p>

<p>When designing an allele-specific knockdown ASO, it is worth exploring whether
alternate sites on the mutant allele also differentiate it from the wild-type
allele &#8211; and hence serve as better targets.</p>

<p>It is not alwasy the case that the best region to target is the mutation
itself, but there may be other sequences along the mutant allele that are more
amenable.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to do phased sequencing (such as long-read sequencing)
between the two alleles to know the full sequence of both alleles confidently.</p>

<p>Regardless of the underlying cause, much of modern drug development rests on

<p>As a result, it is difficult to engage in screening without first being able to
recognize when something has had an effect.</p>

<p>Conducting <a href="#investigational-studies-mechanism">investigational studies into the mechanism of

<p>If an assay can&#8217;t be established at a cellular or cell-free level, then in some
cases, a strong phenotype in a model organism can be used as the basis for a

<p>Given the complexity and cost of model organisms, however, the number of
molecules that can be tested feasibly may be low.</p>

<p>In addition to manual screening, <a href="#virtual-screening">virtual screening</a> may be able to make
therapeutic predictions without resorting to laboratory work.</p>

<p>In lieu of testing large numbers of molecules blindly from compound libraries,

and time may go down, the probability of finding a working candidate molecule
drops as well.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <em>Crowd-sourcing</em> variant interpretation allows experts on relevant genes

<li><p> <em>Crowd-screening</em> suggestions through social media for potential

<p>Biocuration enables bioinformatics techniques to mine the newly structured

<p>Of course, soliciting advice from social media requires filtering out

<h2 id="process:designingametabolicdiet">Process: Designing a metabolic diet</h2>

<p>In the case of a lost <a href="#pathway">metabolic pathway</a>, in which inputs no

<ol>
<li> accumulation of inputs; and</li>
<li> a deficiency in the outputs.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is no alternate pathway to metabolize the input, then (1)
should be examined and if no alternate pathway to synthesize the output
exists, then (2) should be examined.</p>

<p>For example, in the disorder PKU, total loss of function in
phenylalanine hydroxylase leads to an inability to convert the amino
acid phenylalanine into tyrosine.</p>

<p>This suggests two strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Limiting consumption of phenylalanine.</p></li>
<li><p> Increasing consumption of tyrosine.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, strictly limiting consumption of phenylalanine in the diet is an
effective treatment for the disorder, and tyrosine supplementation is
beneficial as well.</p>

<p>As another example, patients with CDG Ib &#8211; a total loss of function in
the gene <em>MPI</em> &#8211; lack an enzyme to interconvert mannose-6-phosphate and
fructose-6-phoshpate. Because this enzyme is the sole provider of
mannose-6-phoshpate, the loss of the enzyme results in a deficiency of
mannose-6-phosphate, a critical precursor to a process called
glycosylation.</p>

<!-- TODO: Cite -->

<p>Adding mannose supplementation to the diet is an effective treatment for
the disorder.</p>

<p>A more common metabolic diet is the restriction of lactose-bearing dairy
products in individuals with lactose intolerance, a result of
insufficient or absent quantities of the enzyme lactase, which breaks

<p>In the specific case where mutant enzymes may retain activity if they

<p>There are substantial drug delivery challenges in enzyme replacement

intracellular compartments that need to be targeted.</p>

<p>The first step toward enzyme replacement therapy is being able to
synthesize the enzyme in a biologically active form.</p>

<p>Therapeutic enzyme synthesis generally uses the transfection of Chinese
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells with DNA containing the gene that encodes the

<h2 id="process:evaluatinggenetically-motivatedtransplantation">Process: Evaluating genetically-motivated transplantation</h2>

<p>In some cases, transplanting organs, tissue or cells that do not contain

<p>In particular, if a disorder results from a missing <a href="#gene-product">gene product</a> and
that gene product can be delivered from another tissue to other cells in
the body, then organ and bone-marrow stem cell transplantation are in
scope.</p>

<p>In a bone marrow transplant, the patient&#8217;s bone marrow is depleted and
then a transfusion of donor stem cells is provided to regrow the bone
marrow.</p>

<p>Moreover, because the donor stem cells don&#8217;t carry the mutation, as they
differentiate in organs and tissues in the body, they will produce cells
not affected by the disorder.</p>

<p>In theory, gene editing could be used on induced pluripotent stem cell
lines for an autologous bone marrow transplant, although more basic
research into accurate gene editing is required before this could be
considered a realistic possibility.</p>

<p>In disorders for which <a href="#genetic-transplantation">genetically-motivated

<p>Two further obstacles make autologous stem cell therapeutics challenging

<h2 id="process:findingtherapiesandtargetswithtranscriptomics">Process: Finding therapies and targets with transcriptomics</h2>

<p>In the context of human disease, transcriptomics (or RNA sequencing) has the
potential to identify genes disregulated as the consequence of the disease.</p>

<p>Transcriptomics also has the potential to bring a diagnosis when genome or
exome sequencing fails, because RNA sequencing can pick up unusual splice
errors or transcript variants that could be hard to find with static sequencing
techniques alone.</p>

<p>If substantial disregulation is identified, then databases like <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/">cMap</a>
and <a href="http://www.lincscloud.org/">LINCS cloud</a> can be used to compute a perturbagenic cocktail of
compounds designed to bring gene regulation closer to baseline.</p>

<p>Care must be taken in interpreting results, as some disregulation could
be a compensatory response to the defect. Some apparent
&#8220;disregulation&#8221; could simply be background variation in the individual.</p>

<p>Transcriptomics requires conducting RNA sequencing on as many patients
and close relatives as possible in order to increase statistical
confidence and separate core disregulation from transcriptional
artifacts.</p>

<p>Restoring baseline expression where disregulation was compensatory could
be anti-therapeutic.</p>

<p>An advantage of a transcriptomics-driven approach to disease
therapeutics is that it holds the potential of addressing a broad class
of downstream mechanisms simultaneously, and it could be utilized even
in the absence of a firm diagnosis, because RNA sequencing can capture a
snapshot of the mechanism of harm as it passes through the
transcriptome.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of a transcriptomics-driven approach is that it does
<em>not</em> target the primary mechanism of harm.</p>

<p>While transcriptomics could be used on the level of an individual
patient given sufficient samples, it is certainly more effective with RNA
sequencing data available from the larger population, since this should
allow it to identify core disregulation in a disorder.</p>

<p>RNA sequencing is not generally available in a clinical context, so this
approach require partnering with an academic partner.</p>

<p>Structure-based drug design and virtual screening are computational

<p>In structure-based drug design, the objective is to design a small
molecule that is roughly opposite in structure and charge to a target
domain on an enzyme.</p>

<p>Before one can conduct structure-based screens, it is necessary to <a href="#process-analyzing-protein-structure">analyze the
structure of the target</a>.</p>

<p>Virtual screening scans compound libraries for potential ability to bind
with and inhibit target domains on proteins.</p>

<p>Because of the approximative nature of computational methods, predicted

<p>High-fidelity virtual screening would often require intractable simulations

<p>Once a <a href="#model-organism-creation">model organism has been created</a> for a
disorder <em>and</em> its phenotype has been robustly characterized, then the
organism may be used as a platform for screening potentially therapeutic
compounds.</p>

<p>For some model organisms, it is possible to employ automation to conduct
phenotyping, which may enable large amounts of compounds to be tested.</p>

<!-- TODO: Add examples -->

<p><a name="genetic-screen"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:conductinggeneticscreens">Process: Conducting genetic screens</h2>

<p>A compound-based screen on a <a href="#precision-disease-model">precision disease model</a> can identify genes
impact the phenotype, but a suppressor screen can identify <em>genes</em> that
modify the phenotype, and these genes may be useful as the basis for
investigating therapeutics.</p>

<p>In a suppressor screen, mutagenic agents are introduced into a large
population of model organisms.</p>

<p>If any of the resulting double mutant organisms show <em>improvement</em> in their
phenotype, then the mutant can be genetically analyzed to determine which gene
was modified.</p>

<p><a name="validating-compounds"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:validatingacandidatecompound">Process: Validating a candidate compound</h2>

<p>If a screen produces a hit or a compound is hypothesized to be therapeutic, the
critical next step is to validate the efficacy of the compound in a model system.</p>

<p>Initial validation involves using the <a href="#discovering-assays">appropriate
assays</a> discovered while <a href="#investigational-studies-mechanism">investigating the
mechanism of harm</a> to determine
whether that compound mitigates a particular mechanism.</p>

<p>For example, if a read-through compound is predicted to increase the
expression of the wild-type protein, an <a href="#antibody">antibody</a> for the protein should
be able to detect its presence.</p>

<p>If validation with cells succeeds or validation with cells is not
possible, the next step is validation against the phenotype of <a href="#model-organism">model
organisms</a>.</p>

<p>If cell-based and organism-based validation succeed, the next step is to
<a href="#apply-medicinal-chemistry">apply medicinal chemistry</a> to the compound to convert it to clinical
material suitable for clinical trials in humans.</p>

<p><a name="apply-medicinal-chemistry"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:applyingmedicinalchemistrytodrugcandidates">Process: Applying medicinal chemistry to drug candidates</h2>

<p>When compounds are first identified either through screening or rational
predictions, it most likely not the case that these compounds will have
regulatory approval, or even that these compounds will be non-toxic and
effective in patients.</p>

<p>As strategies for identifying and developing molecular therapeutics
begin to yield these candidates, for any candidates without regulatory
approval, medicinal chemistry will be required to transform these
compounds into a form suitable for <a href="#conducting-clinical-trials">conducting a clinical
trial</a>.</p>

<p>As a broader discipline, medicinal chemistry aims to manipulate the
efficacy, toxicity and delivery of a compound.</p>

<p>In other words, medicinal chemistry is a multidisciplinary engineering
process that begins with a molecule that demonstrates efficacy on an
assay in cells and ends with a derivative of that molecule that is
<em>intended</em> to be safe and effective.</p>

<p>In general, medicinal chemistry challenges have to be re-solved for each
molecule, although some platforms, such as exosomal encapsulation (see a review
in (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365915300420">Batrakova and Kim,
2015</a>),
provide the possibility of aiding delivery for a larger class of molecules.</p>

<p><a name="crossing-blood-brain-barrier"></a></p>

<h3 id="crossingtheblood-brainbarrier">Crossing the blood-brain barrier</h3>

<p>While there are many challenges in medicinal chemistry, one often stands
out, especially in diseases impacting the brain: crossing the
blood-brain barrier.</p>

<p>The selective permeability of the endothelial cells in the brain prevent
many molecules from crossing, which makes drug delivery to the brain a
major challenge.</p>

<p><a name="enzyme-replacement-challenges"></a></p>

<h3 id="enzymereplacementchallenges">Enzyme replacement challenges</h3>

<p>Enzyme replacement therapy (and large molecule therapy in general) also
requires special considerations, both for its increased challenges in
crossing the blood-brain barrier and also for the need to control
targeting to specific tissues or intracellular compartments.</p>

<p>Enzyme replacement may also require targeting a specific organ, tissue
or intracellular compartment.</p>

<p>Within a cell, targeting the lysosome with a synthetic enzyme is perhaps
among the easiest, because the natural process of phagocytosis naturally
tends to direct large molecules to the lysosome.</p>

<p>For delivery to the cytoplasm of the cell, attaching cell-penetrating
peptides (such as the TAT peptide) to an enzyme can improve cell
penetrance.</p>

<p>PEGylation of the enzyme may also be beneficial in reducing the
immunogenicity of the protein (reducing side effects) and in reducing
renal clearance (improving availability and increasing half-life).</p>

<p><a name="conducting-clinical-trials"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:conductingclinicaltrials">Process: Conducting clinical trials</h2>

<p>Clinical trials attempt to determine the safety and efficacy of a
therapeutic, and they are required by regulatory agencies in most
countries before a compound may be marketed.</p>

<p>Clinical trials typically have four phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Phase 0: First-in-human. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics study. About a dozen volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p> Phase 1: Safety testing. Dose range determination. Side effect observation. A few dozen volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p> Phase 2: Effectiveness testing. A few hundred patient volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p> Phase 3: Large-scale safety and effectiveness testing. A few thousand patient volunteers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Clinical trials are often placebo-controlled and double-blinded, so that
some participants are receiving a therapeutic and others are receiving a
placebo.</p>

<p><a name="single-patient-trial"></a></p>

<h2 id="process:conductingasingle-patient_n_1clinicaltrial">Process: Conducting a single-patient (<em>n</em>=1) clinical trial</h2>

<p>Perhaps one of the greatest epistemological and regulatory challenges
for precision medicine is that there may be so few patients that a
placebo-controlled trial is unlikely to yield the statistical
confidence necessary to validate the approach.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is no regulatory framework in place for
single-patient trials, although <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/personalized-medicine-time-for-one-person-trials-1.17411">proposals for &#8220;n=1&#8221;
trials</a>
are circulating in the academic community.</p>

<p>In the U.S., if a patient wishes to take a compound that does not have
FDA approval, the manufacturer must agree to provide it, and the patient
must petition the FDA for permission through <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Other/ExpandedAccess/ucm20041768.htm">expanded
access</a>.</p>

<h2 id="partii:questionsandanswers">Part II: Questions and answers</h2>

<p>This is part two of the guide.</p>

<p>It began as a glossary, but has evolved into a question and answer
format.</p>

<p>I am striving to explain entries in more patient-friendly language and
in the context of human disease.</p>

<p>In fact, not all of the questions below refer to topics above; some are
there because they may appear in a diagnostic report.</p>

<p>You can read each entry as needed as a reference, but I have tried to
order the questions so that you can also read it top to bottom as a
tutorial on genetics and precision medicine.</p>

<p>It is by no means complete, and I expect to be updating this segment of
the guide regularly.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already trained in a field of science or engineering, then, once
again, I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quickstart-Molecular-Biology-Introductory-Mathematicians/dp/1621820343?crid=1JGTQXK17TJOT&amp;keywords=quickstart+molecular+biology&amp;qid=1658339748&amp;sprefix=quickstart+molecul%2Caps%2C78&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=f25ba58292bb573e6898fadca3b20a05&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Quickstart Molecular Biology</a>:</p>

<p><a name="define-precision-medicine"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisprecisionmedicine">What is precision medicine?</h3>

<p>Defined in a <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13284/toward-precision-medicine-building-a-knowledge-network-for-biomedical-research">National Academies Report on Precision Medicine</a>, precision medicine is the use of data to tailor care to the individual characteristics of a patient.</p>

<p>More specifically, precision medicine focuses on the use of data to identify
and address the cause(s) of disease in a patient as precisely as possible.</p>

<p>The data used in precision medicine tends to be molecular (often genomic) in
nature, although all data is in scope, including the electronic medical record,
genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and every other &#8220;omics&#8221;.</p>

<p>Precision medicine is also extending beyond traditional biomedical sources of
data to include wearable devices or personal electronics or social media.</p>

<p>Precision medicine is not a field of medicine as in cardiology or infectious
diseases, but rather an approach applicable to any field of medicine.</p>

<p><a name="drug-repurposing"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisdrugrepurposing">What is drug repurposing?</h3>

<p>Drug repurposing is the identification of a new purpose for an existing
approved therapy.</p>

<p>Drug repurposing can be done for an entire disorder or for a single patient.</p>

<p>In contrast to drug discovery and development, which seeks to identify and
obtain regulatory approval for a novel therapy, repurposing an existing drug
for a disease or even an individual patient bypasses many regulatory hurdles
and substantially lowers costs.</p>

<p>Physicans have discretion to prescribe approved drugs off-label for other
disorders.</p>

<p>In some cases, an approved drug will work in its available formulation and at
standard dosing.</p>

<p><a name="phenotype"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaphenotype">What is a phenotype?</h3>

<p>In the context of a patient, a phenotype usually refers to a collection of symptoms.</p>

<p>More generally, phenotype refers to the observable or measurable
characteristics of an organism, whether in cells, model organisms or human
patients.</p>

<p>Everything observable &#8211; from hair color to seizures to blood platelet
levels &#8211; counts as part of the phenotype.</p>

<p><a name="genome"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisagenome">What is a genome?</h3>

<p>The human genome is an instruction manual for building and operating a human
being at the molecular level.</p>

<p>This instruction manual exists in every cell of the human body, and it is
encoded in the long string-like molecules of <a href="#DNA">DNA</a>.</p>

<p><a name="genetic-disorder"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisageneticcondition">What is a genetic condition?</h3>

<p>A genetic condition results from damaging alterations to the <a href="#genome">genome</a> of an
organism.</p>

<p>Most genetic conditions are the result of alterations inherited from one or
both parents, and in these, the alterations are present in every cell.</p>

<p>There is a less common class of genetic conditions in which only some
fraction of a patient&#8217;s cells experiences a condition &#8211; a situation known
as <a href="#somatic-mosaicism">somatic mosaicism</a>.</p>

<p>Cancer is an example of an genetic condition that begins with alterations
to the <a href="#genome">genome</a> of a single cell in a previously healthy patient.</p>

<p><a name="exome"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanexome">What is an exome?</h3>

<p>The exome is the part of the <a href="#genome">genome</a> that contains instructions for
constructing <a href="#protein">proteins</a>, and it constitutes about 1% of the entire human
genome.</p>

<p>The remainder of the <a href="#genome">genome</a> outside of the exome is the <a href="#non-coding-region">non-coding region</a>.</p>

<p>Despite its smaller size, it is estimated that most <a href="#genetic-disorder">genetic disorders</a>
arise from mutations that alter <a href="#protein">proteins</a>.</p>

<p>Sequencing the exome instead of the whole genome is an economical way to look
for the root cause of genetic disorders.</p>

<p><a name="mutation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisamutation">What is a mutation?</h3>

<p>A mutation is an <a href="#how-mutation">alteration of the genome</a>.</p>

<p><a name="sequencing"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatissequencing">What is sequencing?</h3>

<p>Sequencing is a process that uses cells (usually from blood) to read the
genome (or exome) of an individual.</p>

<p>Sequencing permits the identification of mutations.</p>

<p>At present, sequencing the exome is less expensive than sequencing the
entire genome.</p>

<p><a name="gene"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisagene">What is a gene?</h3>

<p>A gene is a region in the genome that encodes the instructions for building
a <a href="#gene-product">gene product</a>.</p>

<p><a name="gene-product"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisageneproduct">What is a gene product?</h3>

<p>A gene product is a molecule encoded by a gene.</p>

<p>There two kinds of gene products: <a href="#protein">proteins</a> and <a href="#non-coding-RNA">non-coding RNAs</a>.</p>

<p>In most genetic disorders studied today, errors in protein-coding genes are
responsible, but there are disorders, such as Prader-Willi Syndrome, in
which <a href="#non-coding-RNA">non-coding RNAs</a> are implicated.</p>

<p>A protein-coding <a href="#gene">gene</a> is a region of <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> that contains the instructions
for building a <a href="#protein">protein</a> written in the <a href="#standard-genetic-code">standard genetic code</a>.</p>

<p><a name="protein"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaprotein">What is a protein?</h3>

<p>Protein is a class of molecules that plays a significant role in life.</p>

<p>Proteins are the key actors in cells, and they play many roles, including:</p>

<ul>
<li> enabling molecular transformations and reactions (cellular metabolism);</li>
<li> serving as structures within and between cells;</li>
<li> mediating communication within and between cells;</li>
<li> serving as molecular transporters;</li>
<li> conducting cell replication; and</li>
<li> building and modifying other proteins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Structurally, a protein is a sequence of <a href="#amino-acid">amino acids</a> that <a href="#protein-folding">folds</a> into a
3D shape in order to perform its function.</p>

<p>The instructions for building a protein will be found in a <a href="#gene">gene</a>, and the
instructions will be written in the <a href="#standard-genetic-code">standard genetic code</a>.</p>

<p><a name="DNA"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisdna">What is DNA?</h3>

<p>DNA is a large molecule (a <a href="#define-nucleaic-acid">nucleaic acid</a>) that stores the information within
the genome.</p>

<p>Viewed as information, a DNA molecule is a long word written in an alphabet
containing the letters <code>A</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>G</code>.</p>

<p>At a structural level, DNA is composed of two opposing strands, and each
strand is a sequence of <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a>, and together, the two strands form the
famous double helical structure.</p>

<p>The two opposing strands in a molecule of DNA are related: A&#8217;s and T&#8217;s pair
together between opposing strands and C&#8217;s and G&#8217;s pair together, as in the
following simple example of two strands:</p>

<pre><code>A - T
G - C
T - A
C - G
T - A
</code></pre>

<p>A pair of <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a> linked together within DNA are known as a <a href="#base-pair">base

<p><a name="define-nucleaic-acid"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanucleaicacid">What is a nucleaic acid?</h3>

<p>A nucleaic acid is a chain of <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a> such as <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> or <a href="#DNA">DNA</a>.</p>

<p><a name="define-nucleotide"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanucleotide">What is a nucleotide?</h3>

<p>A nucleotide is a molecule that represents one of the letters in the
alphabet for <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="#RNA">RNA</a>.</p>

<p>The four nucleotides in <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> are adenine (<code>A</code>), thymine (<code>T</code>), guanine
(<code>G</code>) and cytosine (<code>C</code>).</p>

<p>The four nucleotides in <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> are adenine (<code>A</code>), uracil (<code>U</code>), guanine (<code>G</code>)
and cytosine (<code>C</code>).</p>

<h3 id="whatisanucleicacidanalogue">What is a nucleic acid analogue?</h3>

<p>A nucleaic acid analogue is an artificial nucleaic acid (a DNA- or RNA-like
molecule) that may still have the ability to interact with DNA or RNA &#8211; or
with processes that involve them.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="#define-oligonucleotide">oligonucleotide</a> therapeutics, artificial nucleotides using
nucleotide analogues may be used to create RNA- or DNA-like nucleotides and
polymers that can interact with or act like RNA or DNA.</p>

<p>Some of these alternate nucleic acid chemistries are much longer-lived in the
body, making them more suitable for use as a therapeutic.</p>

<p><a name="base-pair"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisabasepair">What is a base pair?</h3>

<p>A base pair is a pairing of two complementary <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a> in <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> on
opposite strands of the <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> helix.</p>

<p><code>A</code> is complementary to <code>T</code>, and <code>C</code> is complementary to <code>G</code>.</p>

<p><a name="rna"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisrna">What is RNA?</h3>

<p>RNA is another information-bearing molecule (a [nucleic acid]) made of
<a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a>. It is similar to <a href="#DNA">DNA</a>, except that it is single-stranded, and
in place of thymine there is uracil.</p>

<p>In terms of information content, RNA is a second molecular alphabet composed
of <code>A</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>G</code>.</p>

<p>When building proteins, <a href="#genes">genes</a> within <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> are <a href="#transcription">transcribed</a> into <a href="#RNA">RNA</a>,
and the RNA is processed before being <a href="#translation">translated</a> into a protein.</p>

<p>(<code>T</code> becomes <code>U</code> during <a href="#transcription">transcription</a> from <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> to RNA.)</p>

<p>In addition to bearing information, some RNA molecules, known as <a href="#non-coding-RNA">non-coding
RNAs</a>, do not translate into proteins, but still have an active biological
role.</p>

<p><a name="non-coding-RNA"></a>
<a name="ncRNA"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisnon-codingrnancrnawhatisfunctionalrna">What is non-coding RNA (ncRNA)? What is functional RNA?</h3>

<p>A non-coding RNA molecule (ncRNA) is an <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> molecule that does not end up
being translated into a protein.</p>

<p>Non-coding RNA may be called <em>functional RNA</em> to emphasize the fact that
even though it does not translate into a <a href="#protein">protein</a>, it may still have an
active biological role, especially in terms of <a href="#gene-regulation">gene regulation</a>.</p>

<p><a name="non-coding-region"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisthenon-codingregionofthegenome">What is the non-coding region of the genome?</h3>

<p>The non-coding region of the <a href="#genome">genome</a> is the region that does not encode
proteins.</p>

<p>Some regions in the non-coding region contain <a href="#non-coding-RNA">non-coding RNAs</a> that do not
become proteins, yet play an active role in the cell.</p>

<p><a name="define-oligonucleotide"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanoligonucleotide">What is an oligonucleotide?</h3>

<!-- TODO: broaden to include alternate nucleotides -->

<p>An oligonucleotide (<em>oligo</em> being Greek meaning &#8220;a few&#8221;) is a short strand
of <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> or <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> or, more generally, any chain of nucleic acid analogues.</p>

<p>These short sequences can play active biological roles, especially in
<a href="#gene-regulation">gene regulation</a> and <a href="#splicing">splicing</a>.</p>

<p>Synthetic oligonucleotides form a potential basis for some therapies.</p>

<p><a name="variant"></a>
<a name="allele"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisavariantallele">What is a variant/allele?</h3>

<p>A <em>variant</em> or <em>allele</em> is a version of a <a href="#gene">gene</a>.</p>

<p>Though all humans have roughly the same set of genes, each of us has two
alleles for most genes &#8211; one from the chromosome from our father, the other
from the chromosome from our mother.</p>

<p>(The exception is for genes on the Y <a href="#chromosome">chromosome</a> in males.)</p>

<p>For most genes, there is a large collection of common variants that make up
the bulk of the alleles in the population.</p>

<p>Mutations in a gene produce new alleles.</p>

<p><a name="wild-type"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisawild-typeallele">What is a wild-type allele?</h3>

<p>A wild-type <a href="#variant">allele</a> for a gene is a commonly occurring non-pathogenic
version found in nature.</p>

<p>In disorders that impact only one of two alleles for a gene, it may be
therapeutic to target the wild-type allele by boosting its activity in loss
of function disorders and reducing its activity in gain of function
disorders.</p>

<p><a name="penetrance"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisthepenetranceofanallelewithrespecttoaphenotype">What is the penetrance of an allele with respect to a phenotype?</h3>

<p>The penetrance of an allele with respect to a phenotype refers to the
percentage of the population that will exhibit that phenotype when that allele
is present.</p>

<p>If a disease-causing allele is highly penetrant, then most of the people with
that allele will suffer the disease.</p>

<p><a name="how-mutation"></a></p>

<h3 id="howdomutationschangeagenome">How do mutations change a genome?</h3>

<p>A mutation is an alteration of the genome (inserting, changing or deleting letters).</p>

<p>In the context of the Gila monster gene, we can imagine a mutation that
transforms the sequence:</p>

<pre><code>AACCTGTATATTCAGTGGCTGAAAGATGGCGGCCCGAGCAGCGGCCGCCCGCCGCCGAGC
</code></pre>

<p>into the sequence:</p>

<pre><code>AACGTGTATATTCAGTGGCTGAAAGATGGCGGCCCGAGCAGCGGCCGCCCGCCGCCGAGC
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the fourth letter was changed from C to G.</p>

<p>Geneticists have even developed a notation (called <a href="#hgvs-notation">HGVS notation</a>) for
describing mutations at the DNA level, and this one would be called
<em>c</em>.4C&gt;G</p>

<p>Under some circumstances, a mutation (or collection of mutations) may lead
to a genetic disorder.</p>

<p>And, when a mutation happens in an individual cell later in life, it may
give rise to cancer.</p>

<p><a name="de-novo"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisa_denovo_mutation">What is a <em>de novo</em> mutation?</h3>

<p>A <em>de novo</em> (a Latin expression implying newness) mutation is one that it is
unique to a child, and not found in either parent.</p>

<p>Through chance, every human being carries a few <em>de novo</em> mutations.</p>

<p>While <em>de novo</em> mutations are usually harmless on their own, they are often
scrutinized in cases of rare disease.</p>

<p><a name="inherited-mutation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaninheritedmutation">What is an inherited mutation?</h3>

<p>A mutation is <em>inherited</em> if it has been passed from parent to child.</p>

<p><a name="germline-mutation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisagermlinemutation">What is a germline mutation?</h3>

<p>A germline mutation is a <em>de novo</em> <a href="#mutation">mutation</a> that occurs early in
development of an organism.</p>

<p>The cells, tissues and organs that descend from the mutant cell carry the
mutation, but the rest do not.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="#somatic-mosaicism">somatic mosaicism</a>.</p>

<p><a name="genotype"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisagenotype">What is a genotype?</h3>

<p>A genotype is the set of <a href="#variant">alleles</a> for a specific organism.</p>

<p>In the context of genetic condition, <em>genotype</em> also refers to the specific alleles
responsible for causing the disease.</p>

<!-- TODO: Example -->

<p>During the diagnostic phase of a genetic disorder, <em>genotype</em> may also refer
to the collection of mutations under suspicion uncovered by <a href="#sequencing">sequencing</a>.</p>

<!-- TODO: Discuss pathogenic genotype -->

<p><a name="pathogenic"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisapathogenicvariantmutation">What is a pathogenic variant/mutation?</h3>

<p>A <a href="#variant">variant</a> is <em>pathogenic</em> if it <em>can</em> cause disease.</p>

<p>Diagnostic reports label <a href="#variant">variants</a> according to their possible
relationship to disease.</p>

<p>The commonly reported classifications for a variant are &#8220;benign,&#8221; &#8220;likely
benign,&#8221; &#8220;uncertain significance,&#8221; &#8220;likely pathogenic,&#8221; or &#8220;pathogenic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many variants are classified as &#8220;uncertain significance,&#8221; meaning it is not
presently known whether the variant can cause disease.</p>

<p>It is critical to note the <a href="#pattern-of-inheritance">inheritance pattern</a> associated with the prediction
of pathogenicity.</p>

<p>For example, if the inheritance pattern is <a href="#recessive">recessive</a>, then <em>both</em> alleles in
that gene must be pathogenic in order to cause disease.</p>

<p>If only one allele is pathogenic in such case, then the person is a <a href="#carrier">carrier</a>
for the disorder, but he or she should not be a patient with the disorder.</p>

<p>(A corner case here would be if the patient has a pathogenic allele for a
recessive disorder paired with a deletion of the allele. In this case, the
resulting total loss of activity in the gene could drive disease.)</p>

<p>Thus, when determining the relevance of all the reported mutations, it makes
sense to ask whether the <a href="#genotype">genotype</a> (the collection of all the mutations)
itself is pathogenic.</p>

<p><a name="pattern-of-inheritance"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatispatternofinheritance">What is pattern of inheritance?</h3>

<p>In the context of human disease, the pattern of inheritance for disease
refers to how genes must be inherited from parents in order to exhibit the
disease.</p>

<p>The three common patterns of inheritance for genetic disorders are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <a href="#recessive">autosomal recessive</a>, in which there is a one in four chance that a
child of two <a href="#carrier">carriers</a> will have the disorder;</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#dominant">autosomal dominant</a>, in which there is a one in two chance that a
child of a <a href="#carrier">carrier</a> will have the disorder; and</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="#x-linked">X-linked</a>, in which there is a one in two chance that the son of a
mother carrying the disorder will have the disorder while daughters have
a one in two chance of being a carrier.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="chromosome"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisachromosome">What is a chromosome?</h3>

<p>At a structural level, a chromosome is a long string of <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> plus
packaging material that holds it together and aids in regulating [gene
expression].</p>

<p>At a genetics level, a chromosome is a collection of <a href="#genes">genes</a>.</p>

<p>Humans carry 23 pairs of chromosomes (for 46 total).</p>

<p>One of these 23 pairs is the sex chromosome pairing &#8211; two X chromosomes
for women, an X and a Y chromosome in men.</p>

<p>Each pair of the remaining pairs are <a href="#autosome">autosomes</a>.</p>

<p><a name="autosome"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanautosome">What is an autosome?</h3>

<p>Within each pair of <a href="#chromosome">chromosomes</a>, each autosome carries a set of
genes redundant (often called &#8220;homologous&#8221;) with the other.</p>

<p>This redundancy built in to autosome pairs provides protection against
mutations: if one <a href="#variant">allele</a> of a <a href="#gene">gene</a> is damaged, there is a good chance
the <a href="#variant">allele</a> on the other autosome is still viable, and in many cases, one
functional copy of a gene is sufficient.</p>

<p>When a condition is &#8220;autosomal&#8221; it means that it involves one of the 22
pairs of autosomal <a href="#chromosome">chromosomes</a>.</p>

<p><a name="x-linked"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanx-linkedcondition">What is an X-linked condition?</h3>

<p>An X-linked condition is one in which a <a href="#gene">gene</a> on the X <a href="#chromosome">chromosome</a> is
impacted.</p>

<p>Because men have only one copy of the X <a href="#chromosome">chromosome</a>, these conditions tend
to present only in men, while women are <a href="#carrier">carriers</a>.</p>

<p>In an X-linked condition, the odds of mother that <a href="#carrier">carries</a> a condition will
produce an affected son is 1 in 4.</p>

<p>If the mother knows she is carrying a boy, the odds of being affected
increase to 1 in 2.</p>

<p><a name="zygosity"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisthedifferencebetweenhomozygousandheterozygous">What is the difference between homozygous and heterozygous?</h3>

<p>An individual is homozygous for a gene if they have two identical <a href="#variant">alleles</a>
for that <a href="#gene">gene</a>.</p>

<p>An individual is heterozygous for a <a href="#gene">gene</a> if they have two different
<a href="#variant">alleles</a> for a <a href="#gene">gene</a>.</p>

<p><a name="compound-heterozygous"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisacompoundheterozygousindividual">What is a compound heterozygous individual?</h3>

<p>In human disease, an individual is compound heterozygous for a gene if they
have two different <a href="#variant">alleles</a> for a <a href="#gene">gene</a>, yet have a recessive disease
caused by that gene.</p>

<p>This is is usually the the result of two different loss of function
alleles.</p>

<p><a name="haplosufficient"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatishaplosufficiency">What is haplosufficiency?</h3>

<p>With the exception of the Y <a href="#chromosome">chromosome</a> in men, each gene has two copies in
the genome.</p>

<p>A haplosufficient gene is one for which only functioning <a href="#variant">allele</a> is
necessary for full function.</p>

<p>A haploinsufficient gene requires both copies of the <a href="#gene">gene</a> for full
function.</p>

<p>When a loss of function variant is discovered for an <a href="#autosome">autosomal</a> gene, it
is important to consider whether that gene is haploinsufficient.</p>

<p><a name="dominant"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisa_dominant_disorder">What is a <em>dominant</em> disorder?</h3>

<p>If a pathogenic mutation can cause disease by itself, then it is <em>dominant</em>.</p>

<p>If a parent has a dominant pathogenic mutation, that parent should have the
disorder, and one out of every two children on average will have the same
disorder.</p>

<p><a name="recessive"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisa_recessive_disorder">What is a <em>recessive</em> disorder?</h3>

<p>If a pathogenic mutation requires being paired with another pathogenic
mutation (usually in the same gene) to cause disease, then it is
<em>recessive</em>.</p>

<p>If someone has only one copy of a recessive mutation, then they are a
<em>carrier</em>.</p>

<p>Many genetic conditions are recessive because humans carry two copies of
most genes (one on each <a href="#autosome">autosome</a>), and usually only one working
copy of a gene is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="carrier"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisacarrier">What is a carrier?</h3>

<p>In the context of human disease, someone is a carrier for a <a href="#recessive">recessive</a>
disorder if they have a <a href="#pathogenic">pathogenic</a> mutation for a <a href="#gene">gene</a> that can cause
the disorder, but also a functioning copy of that gene as well.</p>

<p>Carriers often have no symptoms, and in some cases have mild symptoms.</p>

<p>If two carriers for a <a href="#autosome">autosomal</a> recessive condition have a
child, on average, on out of four children will have the condition.</p>

<p>If a carrier (a mother) for an <a href="#x-linked">X-linked</a> condition has a child, then there
is a one out of two chance that any boy will have the condition.</p>

<p><a name="exon"></a>
<a name="intron"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanexonwhatisanintron">What is an exon? What is an intron?</h3>

<p>In most genes, the sequence of DNA for a gene will be composed of both
exons and introns.</p>

<p>Exons are the subsequences of a gene that encode protein structure, while
the remaining regions between exons &#8211; introns &#8211; are ignored during
protein construction.</p>

<p>When proteins are constructed, there is a <a href="#splicing">splicing</a> phase that removes
introns.</p>

<p>Exome sequencing focuses primarily on exons.</p>

<p><a name="transcription"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatistranscription">What is transcription?</h3>

<p>Transcription is the first phase of converting a <a href="#gene">gene</a> encoded in <a href="#DNA">DNA</a>
into a <a href="#protein">protein</a>.</p>

<p>In transcription, the <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> for a <a href="#gene">gene</a> is copied into its corresponding
RNA <a href="#transcript">transcript</a>.</p>

<p>After some additional processing, <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> is then <a href="#translation">translated</a> into an <a href="#amino-acid">amino
acid</a> sequence, and the <a href="#amino-acid">amino acid</a> sequence folds into a <a href="#protein">protein</a>.</p>

<p>Some strategies for treating <a href="#genetic-disorder">genetic disorders</a> such as readthrough and
<a href="#exon-skipping-therapeutics">exon-skipping</a> involve interacting with the
<a href="#RNA">RNA</a> for a gene after transcription.</p>

<p><a name="example-gene-rna"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanexampleofacodingrnasequenceaftertranscription">What is an example of a coding RNA sequence after transcription?</h3>

<p>For example, once transcribed into the protein-coding portion of the RNA,
the code for the protein from the Gila monster looks like:</p>

</code></pre>

<p><a name="transcript"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisatranscript">What is a transcript?</h3>

<p>A transcript is the <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> molecule that has been produced for a gene.</p>

<p>(A transcript may also be called the <em>primary transcript</em> to distinguish it
from RNA that has been processed through mechanisms such as <a href="#splicing">splicing</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="messenger-RNA"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatismessengerrnamrna">What is messenger RNA (mRNA)?</h3>

<p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> that remains after <a href="#splicing">splicing</a>, and is
destined for <a href="#translation">translation</a> into a <a href="#protein">protein</a>.</p>

<p><a name="rna-sequencing"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisrnasequencing">What is RNA sequencing?</h3>

<p><a href="#RNA">RNA</a> sequencing takes a snapshot of the active RNA <a href="#transcript">transcripts</a> in a cell
at a given time.</p>

<p>RNA sequencing yields insights into which <a href="#gene-expression">genes are
expressed</a> by a particular cell and the quantity of
expression.</p>

<p><a name="transcriptomics"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatistranscriptomics">What is transcriptomics?</h3>

<p>Transcriptomics uses <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> sequencing to interrogate the <a href="#transcript">transcripts</a>
present in specific cells and across time and environments.</p>

<p>Transcriptomics often seeks to discover <a href="#gene-regulation">regulatory
relationships</a> between genes.</p>

<p>In the context of human disease, transcriptomics can identify disregulated
genes and suggest <a href="#process-finding-therapies-with-transcriptomics">corrective therapies</a>.</p>

<p><a name="amino-acid"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanaminoacid">What is an amino acid?</h3>

<p>An amino acid is an individual building block for a <a href="#protein">protein</a>: proteins are
created as chains of amino acids joined together.</p>

<p>Each amino acid has a side chain, with properties such as hydrophobicity
(attracted to or repelled by water) and electrical charge (positive or
negative).</p>

<p>To a large degree, the properties of the side chains determine the structure
and function of the entire protein.</p>

<p>(For example, some proteins require <a href="#chaperone">chaperones</a> to achieve their intended
structure.)</p>

<p>For instance, mutations in <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> can change one amino acid to another in
the resulting protein, which may in turn enhance or degrade the
structure and function of the resulting <a href="#protein">protein</a>.</p>

<p>There are 20 standard amino acids ordinarily used for <a href="#protein-synthesis">protein synthesis</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li> Alanine (Ala, A)</li>
<li> Arginine (Arg, R)</li>
<li> Asparagine (Asn, N)</li>
<li> Aspartic acid (Asp, D)</li>
<li> Cysteine (Cys, C)</li>
<li> Glutamine (Gln, Q)</li>
<li> Glutamic acid (Glu, E)</li>
<li> Glycine (Gly, G)</li>
<li> Histidine (His, H)</li>
<li> Isoleucine (Ile, I)</li>
<li> Leucine (Leu, L)</li>
<li> Lysine (Lys, K)</li>
<li> Methionine (Met, M)</li>
<li> Phenylalanine (Phe, F)</li>
<li> Proline (Pro, P)</li>
<li> Serine (Ser, S)</li>
<li> Threonine (Thr, T)</li>
<li> Tryptophan (Trp, W)</li>
<li> Tyrosine (Tyr, Y)</li>
<li> Valine (Val, V)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each amino acid is represented by one or more <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codons</a> in the <a href="#standard-genetic-code">standard
genetic code</a>.</p>

<p>Under the running example of the Gila monster protein, the chain of amino
acids encoded by the gene becomes:</p>

<p><a name="protein-synthesis"></a></p>

<h3 id="howareproteinscreated">How are proteins created?</h3>

<p>During the construction of a protein (often called protein synthesis), a
gene is first <a href="#transcription">transcribed</a> into RNA.</p>

<p>Once transcribed into <a href="#RNA">RNA</a>, the <a href="#intron">introns</a> are <a href="#splicing">spliced</a> out.</p>

<p>The resulting RNA, which contains only the <a href="#exon">exons</a>, is called <a href="#messenger-RNA">messenger RNA</a>
(mRNA).</p>

<p>The <a href="#messenger-RNA">messenger RNA</a> is <a href="#translation">translated</a> into a sequence of amino
acids according to the <a href="#standard-genetic-code">standard genetic code</a>.</p>

<p>Many proteins are further modified through <a href="#post-translational-modification">post-translational
modifications</a> after synthesis.</p>

<p><a name="splicing"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisrnasplicing">What is RNA splicing?</h3>

<p>When the <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> for a gene is first transcribed into <a href="#RNA">RNA</a>, it contains both
<a href="#exon">exons</a>&nbsp;(which contain part of the code for a protein) and <a href="#intron">introns</a>
(which do not).</p>

<p><a href="#RNA">RNA</a> splicing is the phase in which the nucleotides for <a href="#intron">introns</a> are
removed.</p>

<p>For protein-coding genes, the resulting <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> is <a href="#messenger-RNA">messenger RNA</a>.</p>

<p>Mutations in <a href="#intron">introns</a> that impact splicing can still result in pathogenic
alterations to the resulting protein.</p>

<p>In some cases, splicing will also remove <a href="#exon">exons</a>, resulting in a <a href="#transcript-variant">transcript
variant</a>.</p>

<p><a name="transcript-variant"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisatranscriptsplicevariant">What is a transcript/splice variant?</h3>

<p>When a <a href="#splicing">RNA splicing</a> removes one or more exons, it creates transcript
variants.</p>

<p>Transcript variants lead to different proteins, some of which have
modified functionality.</p>

<p>Attempting to force the synthesis of an transcript variant by
<a href="#exon-skipping-therapeutics">deliberating skipping an exon</a> is a
therapeutic strategy for some mutations.</p>

<p>Since <a href="#mutation">mutations</a> are usually reported with respect to a transcript variant,
it is important to make sure that the transcript variants are identical when
comparing mutations, or else to interconvert the mutations between
transcript variants.</p>

<p><a name="standard-genetic-code"></a>
<a name="codon"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisthestandardgeneticcodewhatisacodon">What is the standard genetic code? What is a codon?</h3>

<p>The standard genetic code maps three-letter patterns in DNA to codons.</p>

<p>A codon is an individual instruction in the list of instructions for
building a protein.</p>

<p>A codon encodes one of two types of instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> insert a specific amino acid next; and</p></li>
<li><p> stop production of the protein.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the DNA codon <code>ATG</code> (which becomes <code>AUG</code> in RNA) means
&#8220;insert a methionine next,&#8221; while DNA codon <code>TGA</code> (which becomes <code>UGA</code>
in RNA) means &#8220;stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are 64 possible codons, but only 20 of them represent unique amino
acids. (For example, <code>AAA</code> and <code>AAG</code> both mean &#8220;insert a Lysine.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Under this interpretation of DNA, we can re-orient the Gila monster gene
into codons and their corresponding instructions, much as if it were a
computer program or a recipe:</p>

<pre><code>AAC;  // Insert Asparagine
CTG;  // Insert Leucine
TAT;  // Insert Tyrosine
ATT;  // Insert Isoleucine
CAG;  // Insert Glutamine
TGG;  // Insert Tryptophan
CTG;  // Insert Leucine
AAA;  // Insert Lysine
GAT;  // Insert Aspartic Acid
GGC;  // Insert Glycine
GGC;  // Insert Glycine
CCG;  // Insert Proline
AGC;  // Insert Serine
AGC;  // Insert Serine
GGC;  // Insert Glycine
CGC;  // Insert Arginine
CCG;  // Insert Proline
CCG;  // Insert Proline
CCG;  // Insert Proline
AGC;  // Insert Serine
TGA;  // Stop
</code></pre>

<p>After running this program, we have the following sequence of amino
acids stitched together:</p>

<p><a name="translation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisproteintranslation">What is protein translation?</h3>

<p>During protein synthesis, protein translation is the construction of an
amino acid sequence from the corresponding RNA under the standard genetic
code.</p>

<p><a name="proteomics"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisproteomics">What is proteomics?</h3>

<p>Proteomics interrogates all of the <a href="#protein">proteins</a>
present in specific cells and across time and environments.</p>

<p>At present, there are a variety of approaches for conducting proteomics.</p>

<p>In the context of human disease, proteomics can identify disregulated
proteins and suggest <a href="#proteomics-therapeutics">corrective therapies</a>.</p>

<p><a name="mutation-types"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatarethetypesofmutationsinproteins">What are the types of mutations in proteins?</h3>

<p>With an understanding of the <a href="#standard-genetic-code">standard genetic code</a>, it is possible to
categorize mutations according to their impact on the protein.</p>

<p>The major categories for mutations in protein-coding region of genes
are:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="#premature-stop">premature stop mutations</a>;</li>
<li> <a href="#frameshift">frameshift mutations</a>;</li>
<li> <a href="#in-frame">in-frame mutations</a>;</li>
<li> <a href="#missense">missense mutations</a>; and</li>
<li> <a href="#synonymous">synonymous mutations</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="hgvs-notation"></a></p>

<h3 id="howdoyouinterprethgvsnotationformutations">How do you interpret HGVS notation for mutations?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/">HGVS specification</a> provides a shorthand notation for describing
mutations in a <a href="#gene">gene</a>.</p>

<p>Variants are commonly reported in two different ways at the same time, in
the coding <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> notation and in the protein-coding notation.</p>

<p>The coding <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> notation (prefixed with <em>c</em>.) indicates at which
<a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotide</a> in the <em>coding</em> DNA the mutation starts and what kind of
<a href="#mutation">mutation</a> it was.</p>

<p>The coding DNA is the <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> that remains when the <a href="#intron">introns</a> are <a href="#splicing">spliced</a>
out.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <em>c</em>.24G&gt;C means that the 24rd <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotide</a> was changed from G to C.</p></li>
<li><p> <em>c</em>.24Cdel means that the 24th <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotide</a> was deleted.</p></li>
<li><p> _c._67_68insT means that a T was inserted between <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a> 67 and 68.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The protein-coding notation (prefixed with <em>p</em>.) indicates the effect of a
mutation on the <a href="#amino-acid">amino acid</a> sequence for a protein.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <em>p</em>.R401X means that the 401st <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a> was changed from an arginine
<a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a> to a stop <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a>. (Possibly also written <em>p</em>.Arg401Ter or
<em>p</em>.Arg401*)</p></li>
<li><p> <em>p</em>.Q631SfsX7 means that the 631st <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a> was changed from a glutamine
to a serine due to a <a href="#frameshift">frameshift</a> mutation that resulted in a new stop
<a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a> 7 <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codons</a> away. (Possibly als written as <em>p</em>.Gln631fsTer7 or
<em>p</em>.Gln641fs*7)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="premature-stop"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaprematurestopframestopnonsensemutation">What is a premature stop / framestop / nonsense mutation?</h3>

<p>A premature stop (also called <em>nonsense</em>) <a href="#mutation">mutation</a> truncates
construction of the protein by turning a codon for an amino acid into a
stop codon.</p>

<p>For example, changing the first <code>A</code> to <code>T</code> in <code>AGA</code> turns it into <code>TGA</code>.</p>

<p><code>AGA</code> codes for the amino acid arginine, but <code>TGA</code> codes for stop.</p>

<p>Truncation usually destroys the function of the resulting protein. (In
fact, nonsense-mediated decay may even prevent the production of
proteins with such mutations.)</p>

<p>For example, the mutation <em>p</em>.R401X (possibly also written <em>p</em>.Arg401Ter
or <em>p</em>.Arg401*) indicates that the 401st amino acid (an arginine) has
been replaced by a stop <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a>.</p>

<p>For a premature stop mutation, [readthrough compounds] (#readthrough-therapeutics) should be investigated as potential therapeutics.</p>

<p><a name="frameshift"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaframeshiftmutation">What is a frameshift mutation?</h3>

<p>A mutation that inserts or deletes a number of nucleotides that is not
an even multiple of three will cause a &#8220;frameshift&#8221; in which subsequent
<a href="#standard-genetic-code">codons</a> are misinterpreted.</p>

<p>Frameshifts almost always cause a loss of function mutation in the
resulting protein.</p>

<p>For example, <em>c</em>.C1891del (also written as <em>p</em>.Q631SfsX7) indicates that a
the 1,891st <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotide</a> in the coding DNA for a protein (in this case a
cytosine) was deleted, which caused the <a href="#standard-genetic-code">codon</a> at position 631 (formerly a
glutamine) and all subsequent codons to be garbled, until the introduction
of a stop seven codons down.</p>

<p><a name="in-frame"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanin-framemutation">What is an in-frame mutation?</h3>

<p>An in-frame mutation is an insertion or deletion of <a href="#define-nucleotide">nucleotides</a> in a
protein-coding region which is an even multiple of three.</p>

<p>This may add or remove one or several <a href="#amino-acid">amino acids</a>.</p>

<p>In-frame mutations are generally less damaging than premature stop or
frameshift mutations.</p>

<p><a name="missense"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisamissensemutation">What is a missense mutation?</h3>

<p>A missense mutations changes a codon from one amino acid to another.</p>

<p>If a missense changes the type of the side chain of the amino acid (e.g.
hydrophobic to polar, positive to negative) it is more likely to damage
the function of the protein than missense mutations that do not.</p>

<p>For example, <em>p</em>.W244R indicates a tryptophan has become an arginine at
codon 244 (which changes a hydrophobic side chain to into a positively
charged side chain). In some cases, this could be a loss of function
mutation.</p>

<p>To be clear, even a mutation that does not change the side chain type
(such as alinine to valine) can still be pathogenic, as it can <em>alter</em>
the function of the protein, <a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/10/1823">as in the case of prion
disease</a>.</p>

<p>If the effect of a missense mutation is unclear, <a href="#homology-modeling">homology
modeling</a> may provide insight into the pathogenicity based
on its impact on structure.</p>

<p><a name="synonymous"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisasynonymousmutation">What is a synonymous mutation?</h3>

<p>A synonymous mutation changes the underlying nucleotides for a codon,
but it does not change the amino acid.</p>

<p>For example, a mutation that changes <code>TTA</code> into <code>TTG</code> probably has no
effect, since both codons insert the amino acid Leucine.</p>

<p><a name="protein-folding"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisproteinfolding">What is protein folding?</h3>

<p>Once a protein is <a href="#protein-synthesis">synthesized</a> as a chain of <a href="#amino-acid">amino
acids</a>, that chain begins folding into a 3D structure determined by the side
chains on its amino acids; properties such as the acidity (pH) of its
environment and temperature and the presence of <a href="#chaperone">chaperone proteins</a>.</p>

<p>As a principle, folding tends to minimize the number of hydrophobic
(&#8220;water-fearing&#8221;) side chains on the exterior of the final form.</p>

<p>The final structure of the protein determines its function.</p>

<p>As an example, the Gila monster protein, after folding into its 3D shape,
looks like:</p>

<p>Proteins that fail to fold correctly can lead to human disease.</p>

<p><a name="primary-protein-structure"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisprimaryproteinstructure">What is primary protein structure?</h3>

<p>The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of <a href="#amino-acid">amino acids</a> from which
it is made.</p>

<p><a name="secondary-protein-structure"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatissecondaryproteinstructure">What is secondary protein structure?</h3>

<p>Secondary protein structure refers to commonly occurring local units of
structure in proteins that span several amino acids. A beta sheet is an
example of a commonly occurring secondary unit of structure.</p>

<p><a name="tertiary-protein-structure"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisatertiaryproteinstructure">What is a tertiary protein structure?</h3>

<p>Tertiary protein structure refers to the 3D shape of a protein after <a href="#protein-folding">folding</a>
is complete.</p>

<p><a name="quaternary-protein-structure"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaquaternaryproteinstructure">What is a quaternary protein structure?</h3>

<p>Quaternary protein structure refers to the arrangements of multiple proteins in
a <a href="#protein-complex">complex</a>.</p>

<p><a name="protein-complex"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaproteincomplex">What is a protein complex?</h3>

<p>A protein complex is a multi-protein structure.</p>

<p><a name="simulated-protein-folding"></a>
<a name="homology-modeling"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatishomologymodelingsimulatedproteinfolding">What is homology modeling / simulated protein folding?</h3>

<p>Homology modeling attempts to reconstruct the 3D structure of a protein based
on its amino acid sequence and its similarity to the known 3D structure of a
similar sequence of sequences.</p>

<p>For example, if the structure of a wild-type allele is known, then changing
only one amino acid makes it possible to estimate what the new structure may
look like without attempting to solve the entire 3D structure from scratch.</p>

<p>Protein folding simulation is a technique in computational biology for
predicting the folded structure of a protein.</p>

<p>While <em>ab initio</em> <a href="#protein-folding">protein folding</a> simulations can be computationally
expensive and accuracy is problematic, a computed folding may offer evidence
as to whether <a href="#domain">domains of function</a> in a protein are still functional, or
whether their <a href="#binding-affinity">binding affinity</a> has been altered.</p>

<p>Programs such as <a href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2">Phyre2</a> attempt to predict the folding of a protein
from sequence data, which may yield insight into the structure of a
mutant protein.</p>

<!-- TODO: check this -->
<a name="crystallography"></a>

<h3 id="whatiscrystallography">What is crystallography?</h3>

<p>Crystallography is a collection of methods for studying and determining the
structure of a crystal.</p>

<p>By freezing proteins into crystals, crystallography (in particular, x-ray
crystallography), can determine their 3D structure.</p>

<p><a name="antisense-oligonucleotide"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanantisenseoligonucleotide">What is an antisense oligonucleotide?</h3>

<p>An antisense <a href="#define-oligonucleotide">oligonucleotide</a> is a short sequence of RNA- or DNA-like
nucleotides designed to bind to a particular target sequence or sequence(s).</p>

<p>For example, if the <a href="#RNA">RNA</a> sequence to be targeted is <code>AUAG</code>, then the
antisense oligonucleotide is <code>UAUC</code>.</p>

<p>Because antisense oligonucleotides bind to their complements, they can
mute them during protein translation.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="#knockdown">knockdown</a> model organisms, these complementary fragments of
<a href="#RNA">RNA</a> can silence an entire gene.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="#exon-skipping-therapeutics">exon-skipping therapeutics</a>,
an antisense oligonucleotide for a particular <a href="#exon">exon</a> (such as the one
containing the harmful mutation) can cause the <a href="#exon">exon</a> to be <a href="#splicing">spliced</a> out
during <a href="#protein-synthesis">protein construction</a>.</p>

<p><a name="post-translational-modification"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisapost-translationalmodification">What is a post-translational modification?</h3>

<p><a href="#protein">Proteins</a> are often modified after translation by processes such as
glycosylation, <a href="#define-phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> or methylation.</p>

<p>The sites at which proteins are modified is often based on consensus
sequences among <a href="#amino-acid">amino acids</a> in a protein.</p>

<p>There are a variety of tools for predicting <a href="http://www.expasy.org/proteomics/post-translational_modification">post-translational modification
sites</a>.</p>

<p>For example, N-linked glycans are usually attached to <a href="#protein">proteins</a> at an
asparagine which is followed by any <a href="#amino-acid">amino acid</a> except proline
followed by either a serine or threonine.</p>

<p>A mutation that alters the consensus sequence &#8211; for instance changing the
asparagine to an aspartate &#8211; would likely prevent N-linked glycans from
being attached, which may in turn alter the function or stability of the
resulting protein.</p>

<p><a name="protein-types"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatfunctionsdoproteinshave">What functions do proteins have?</h3>

<p>Proteins serve a variety of functions within a cell.</p>

<p>In a genetic disorder that involves a protein, the type of protein involved
may influence therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Major types of proteins include:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="#enzyme">enzymes</a>;</li>
<li> receptors;</li>
<li> <a href="#chaperone">chaperones</a>;</li>
<li> hormone/signaling proteins;</li>
<li> storage proteins;</li>
<li> motor proteins;</li>
<li> immune proteins;</li>
<li> protective proteins;</li>
<li> transporter proteins;</li>
<li> structural proteins; and</li>
<li> regulatory proteins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some proteins have more than one type.</p>

<p><a name="domain"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisadomainoffunction">What is a domain of function?</h3>

<p>A domain of function is a region within a protein that is responsible
for a specific function.</p>

<p>A given <a href="#protein">protein</a> may have several domains which work together, domains
that work independently or some combination thereof.</p>

<p>When analyzing mutations, it is useful to examine their potential impact
on the known domains of function within that protein.</p>

<p><a name="enzyme"></a>
<a name="metabolic-pathway"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanenzymewhatisametabolicpathway">What is an enzyme? What is a metabolic pathway?</h3>

<p>An enzyme is a protein that enables chemical reactions and molecular
transformations.</p>

<p>Thus, an enzyme creates a metabolic pathway from the inputs to the reaction
to the outputs of the reactions.</p>

<p>A metabolic pathway is an enzyme-driven process for conducting chemical
reactions and molecular transformations.</p>

<p>A pathway diagram for the enzyme lactase illustrates the pathway:</p>

<pre><code>              ----&gt; galactose
            /
lactose ---
            \
              ----&gt; glucose
</code></pre>

<p>Some humans with mutations in the gene for lactase &#8211; <em>LCT</em> &#8211; cannot produce
lactase, and as a result, they cannot digest lactose, a condition known as
lactose intolerance.</p>

<p>(In fact, as humans age, they produce less lactase, resulting in increasing
lactose intolerance as this pathway shuts down.)</p>

<p>Collectively, enzymes and the pathways they define determine the metabolism
of an organism.</p>

<p><a name="substrate"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisasubstrate">What is a substrate?</h3>

<p>A substrate is a compound on which an enzyme acts.</p>

<p>For example, for the enzyme lactase, its substrate is lactose.</p>

<p><a name="transporter-protein"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisatransporterprotein">What is a transporter protein?</h3>

<p>A membrane transporter protein is like an automatic door on the surface of the
cell (or an intracellular compartment) that only opens for specific molecules.</p>

<p>Membrane transporter proteins are selectively permeable membrane-bound
proteins that regulate the movements of molecules inside and outside of a
cell and between intracellular compartments.</p>

<p>Ion channels are an example of a transporter protein.</p>

<p><a name="ion-channel"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanionchannel">What is an ion channel?</h3>

<p>Ion channels are formed by membrane-bound <a href="#transporter-protein">transporter proteins</a> that
regulate the flow of ions into and out of a cell or intracellular
compartment.</p>

<p>A defect in a ion channel protein can lead to a <a href="#channelopathy">channelopathy</a>.</p>

<p><a name="channelopathy"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisachannelopathy">What is a channelopathy?</h3>

<p>Channelopathies are disorders caused by defects in ion channel proteins &#8211;
specific class of transporter protein &#8211; which regulate the flow of ions
across a membrane.</p>

<p><a name="receptor"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisareceptor">What is a receptor?</h3>

<p>Receptors are (generally) membrane-bound proteins that transmit signals
across a membrane boundary, often from outside a cell to inside a cell.</p>

<p>When an agonist docks with its target receptor, it causes the release of
a <a href="#secondary-messenger">secondary messenger</a> compound on the opposite side of the membrane.</p>

<p>Receptors can have a baseline activity level &#8211; known as constitutive
activity &#8211; even in the absence of their agonist.</p>

<p>With receptors, antagonists play the role of inhibitors, blocking
agonists from reaching the receptor and preventing the transmission of a
signal.</p>

<p>Unlike enzymes, receptors may also be susceptible to an inverse agonist,
which lower their constitutive activity. (Enzymes have no background
activity in the absence of a substrate.)</p>

<p><a name="define-kinase"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisakinase">What is a kinase?</h3>

<p>A kinase is a protein that transfers phosphate groups onto other molecules,
most commonly other proteins.</p>

<p>Kinases may also transfer phosphate groups onto lipids (fats) or onto
carbohydrates.</p>

<p>The process of transferring phosphate groups onto molecules is called
<a href="#define-phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a>.</p>

<p>When phosphorylating, a kinase typically targets a specific amino acid residue
on the protein.</p>

<p><a name="define-phosphorylation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisphosphorylation">What is phosphorylation?</h3>

<p>Phosphorylation is a common <a href="#post-translational-modification">post-translational modification</a> for proteins.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation is the process of transferring phosphate groups onto molecules
like proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.</p>

<p><a href="#define-kinase">Kinases</a> are the class of proteins repsonsible for this transfer.</p>

<p>The addition of a phosphate group may activate or inactive the protein.</p>

<p>Dephosphorylation is the process of removing a phosphate group, and a major
group of proteins responsible for this reverse process are phosphotases.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation constitute a major dynamic regulatory
mechanism within biology.</p>

<p><a name="constitutive-activity"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisconstitutiveactivity">What is constitutive activity?</h3>

<p>Constitutive activity is the baseline activity of a receptor in the absence
of an agonist.</p>

<p><a name="secondary-messenger"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisasecondarymessenger">What is a secondary messenger?</h3>

<p>A secondary messenger is the compound released by a <a href="#receptor">receptor</a> when
stimulated by an <a href="#agonist">agonist</a> on the opposing side of a membrane.</p>

<p>A secondary messenger may trigger a cascade of reactions to the external
stimulus.</p>

<p><a name="agonist"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanagonist">What is an agonist?</h3>

<p>An agonist is an agent that stimulates a <a href="#receptor">receptor</a> to release its <a href="#secondary-messenger">secondary
messenger</a>.</p>

<p><a name="antagonist"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanantagonist">What is an antagonist?</h3>

<p>An antagonist is an agent that prevents an <a href="#agonist">agonist</a> from stimulating a
<a href="#receptor">receptor</a>.</p>

<p><a name="inverse-agonist"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaninverseagonist">What is an inverse agonist?</h3>

<p>An inverse agonist lowers the <a href="#constitutive-activity">constitutive activity</a> of a <a href="#receptor">receptor</a>.</p>

<p><a name="#chaperone"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisachaperone">What is a chaperone?</h3>

<p>A chaperone protein aids in the folding of other <a href="#protein">proteins</a>, or helps to
maintain protein folding in the presence of stress (such as a higher
temperature).</p>

<p><a name="cytogenetic-notation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatiscytogeneticnotation">What is cytogenetic notation?</h3>

<p>Cytogenetic notation is the notation used to describe regions
within <a href="#chromosome">chromosomes</a>.</p>

<p>The general format of the notation is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;chromosome number&gt; 'p' or 'q' &lt;band number&gt; . &lt;sub-band number&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For example, <code>3p24.2</code> indicates chromosome 3, <code>p</code> indicates the short
arm of the chromosome, <code>24</code> is the 24th colored band, and <code>.2</code> indicates
the second sub-band within the 24th band.</p>

<p>Characteristic bands show up on <a href="#chromosome">chromosomes</a> when they&#8217;re stained with
trypsin, and these bands are identify regions.</p>

<p>In a condition with chromosomal abnormalities, it is important to to
determine from the cytogenic notation which regions of the chromosome
have been deleted or duplicated.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC genome browser</a> can list all of the impacted genes in a
region.</p>

<p>With the advent of <a href="#sequencing">sequencing</a>, chromosomal abnormalities
are now often reported in very specific ranges of base pairs.</p>

<p><a name="somatic-mosaicism"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatissomaticmosaicism">What is somatic mosaicism?</h3>

<p>Somatic mosaicism is the technical term for what happens when mutations
happen early on during development &#8211; in the germline.</p>

<p>For example, if a mutation happens in a cell when a developing human being is
roughly ten cells, than that <a href="#mutation">mutation</a> may be present in about 10% of the
resulting cells.</p>

<p>Somatic mosaicism can lead to an individual suffering from a disorder
incompletely, and it can also complicate diagnostic sequencing: if the tissue
used for <a href="#sequencing">sequencing</a> does not contain the <a href="#pathogenic">pathogenic</a> mutation, then
sequencing will not find it.</p>

<p><a name="mechanism-of-harm"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisamechanismofharm">What is a mechanism of harm?</h3>

<p>A mechanism of harm is the process by which a diseases causes harm.</p>

<p>The primary mechanism of harm is the root cause of the disorder, which
in the cause of genetic disorders, is a mutation or group of mutations.</p>

<p>A downstream mechanism of harm is a later link in the chain of causes.</p>

<p>For example, in cystic fibrosis, according to
(<a href="http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/05.09/05.09.0595.pdf">Ratjen, 2009</a>)
the initial loss of function in the CFTR gene leads to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> defective chloride and thiocyanate ion transport across cell membranes;</p></li>
<li><p> which leads to loss of surface liquid in the airway;</p></li>
<li><p> which leads to destabilization of cilia and loss of mucociliary transport;</p></li>
<li><p> which leads to retention of phlegm;</p></li>
<li><p> which leads to infection;</p></li>
<li><p> which leads to inflammation;</p></li>
<li><p> which in turn aggravates the retention of phlegm.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It may be possible to devise therapeutic strategies that intervene at any
link in the chain between mechanisms of harm.</p>

<p><a name="precision-disease-model"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaprecisiondiseasemodel">What is a precision disease model?</h3>

<p>A precision disease model is a biological avatar that encodes key aspects of a
patient&#8217;s disease.</p>

<p>A precision disease model can be a cellular model or a <a href="#model-organism">model organism</a>.</p>

<p>A cellular model can be constructed directly from the patient&#8217;s own cells, or
it can be created from another cell line, usually by genetically editing the
cell line to match the patient&#8217;s genotype.</p>

<p><a name="model-organism"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisamodelorganism">What is a model organism?</h3>

<p>A model organism is an organism that has been genetically modified or
bred to exhibit a specific <a href="#phenotype">phenotype</a> or the analog of a human disorder.</p>

<p>Common model organisms include:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>E. coli</em> bacteria;</li>
<li> yeast (often <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>);</li>
<li> worms (often <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>);</li>
<li> fruit flies (often <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>);</li>
<li> zebrafish (<em>Danio rario</em>);</li>
<li> mice; and</li>
<li> rats;</li>
</ul>

<p>and there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_model_organisms">dozens of other model organisms</a> also used in research.</p>

<p>In the context of genetic disorders, model organisms may have human
mutations introduced (a knock-in), or an entire gene removed (a knockout).</p>

<p><a href="#process-creating-model-organisms">Creating model organisms</a> is useful in many
stages of disease research, from discovery and diagnosis to the development
of therapeutics.</p>

<p><a name="knockout"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaknockoutorganism">What is a knockout organism?</h3>

<p>A knockout organism is one in which a gene has been removed.</p>

<p>Knockout organisms are useful for studying the role of a particular gene.</p>

<p>Knockout organisms are also useful for studying recessive disorders in
which the primary mechanism is total loss of function in a gene.</p>

<p><a name="knockdown"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaknockdownorganism">What is a knockdown organism?</h3>

<p>By introducing interfering RNA for a specific gene into to cells, it is
possible to dial down (and even eliminate) the expression of a target gene.</p>

<p>When the interfering RNA is introduced exogenously, the interfering RNA is
eventually depleted and gene activity is restored.</p>

<p>It is also possible to construct permanent knockdowns, in which gene
expression is dialed down through genetic modification.</p>

<p>Because the amount of interfering RNA can be varied, it is posible to study
the effect of differing levels of expression of a gene.</p>

<p><a name="knockin"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisaknock-inorganism">What is a knock-in organism?</h3>

<p>A knock-in organism is one in which a specific gene has been introduced.</p>

<p>In organisms that contain the equivalent of a human gene, the human version
can be inserted to test its functional equivalence and conservation.</p>

<p>In addition, a disease-causing version of a gene from a human patient can
be knocked in to create a more faithful model organism in which to study a
disorder.</p>

<p>Some therapeutic strategies can only be tested on knock-in models. For
example, <a href="#process-inhibiting-or-activating-a-target">activating a mutant allele</a> only
works if there is a mutant allele to upregulate.</p>

<p><a name="fibroblast"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisafibroblast">What is a fibroblast?</h3>

<p>In the context of human disease, a fibroblast cell line is a cell line
usually created from the skin of patients (and sometimes family members).</p>

<p><a name="stem-cell"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisastemcellwhatisanipscell">What is a stem cell? What is an iPS cell?</h3>

<p>A stem cell is an immature cell that can be differentiated into many
different cell types, e.g., skin, cardiac tissue, neurons.</p>

<p>Embyronic stem cells are the most differentiable.</p>

<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are mature adult cells that have
been reprogrammed to behave like early stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="ipsc-advantages"></a></p>

<h3 id="whataretheadvantagesofipscelllines">What are the advantages of iPS cell lines?</h3>

<p>For <a href="#genetic-disorder">genetic disorders</a>, iPS cells make it possible to obtain tissue types
which may otherwise be difficult or impossible to extract directly from
patients.</p>

<p><a name="biomarker"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisabiomarker">What is a biomarker?</h3>

<p>A biomarker is an observable indicator of a disease state, often used is
clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of a therapy.</p>

<p>An example of a biomarker is the presence of oligosaccharides in urine; this
is a biomarker for many lysosomal storage diseases.</p>

<p>As another example, low protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a
biomarker for <a href="http://www.ngly1.org/">NGLY1 deficiency</a>.</p>

<p><a name="assay"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanassay">What is an assay?</h3>

<p>In biochemistry, an assay is a technique for measuring a property of
interest in a sample.</p>

<p>An assay is defined by both a process and a collection of material
necessary to execute the process.</p>

<p>Assays are often run by hand, but in some cases, they may be automated
for high-throughput screening.</p>

<p>From the perspective of practicing precision medicine, it is critical to
note that developing an assay may require an act of scientific
discovery, which in turn hinges on the creative process underpinning
scientific progress.</p>

<p>For example, an assay that targets the primary mechanism of harm in an
enzyme deficiency disorder will (somehow) measure the activity of the
enzyme.</p>

<p>Running the assay on patient cells should show no activity for the
enzyme, while running the assay on control cells should show
activity for the enzyme.</p>

<p>In this example, the assays is useful for validating compounds predicted
to restore the activity of the missing enzyme.</p>

<p>For instance, if patient cells are treated with the compound and then run
through the assay, and it shows activity, then the compound may be a target
for drug development.</p>

<p><a name="molecular-therapy"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisamoleculartherapy">What is a molecular therapy?</h3>

<p>A molecular therapy is one that targets the molecular basis for a disorder.</p>

<p>In a <a href="#genetic-disorder">genetic disorder</a>, a molecular therapy can attempt to correct a mutation
itself at a genetic level (as in gene-editing or readthrough therapeutics),
or it can attempt to compensate at the protein level (as in mutant protein
stabilization), or it can intervene at a downstream <a href="#mechanism-of-harm">mechanism of
harm</a> with a molecular basis.</p>

<p><a name="gene-expression"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisgeneexpression">What is gene expression?</h3>

<p>Gene expression refers to the presence and quantity of the <a href="#gene-product">gene product</a>
associated with a <a href="#gene">gene</a>, and to the act of creating the <a href="#gene-product">gene product</a>.</p>

<p>Increasing gene expression for a protein-coding gene implies increasing the
<a href="#protein">protein</a> encoded by that gene.</p>

<p>In some contexts, increasing gene expression refers to increasing the RNA
transcription for the gene (and assuming a corresponding increase in the
protein).</p>

<p><a name="gene-regulation"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisgeneregulation">What is gene regulation?</h3>

<p>Gene regulation refers to the processes and entities that manage the
expression of genes.</p>

<p>Even though every cell (except for sperm and eggs) contains every gene for
an individual, not every cell expresses all of the gene products associated
with every gene, and even with a cell, the proteins being expressed depend
on the environment and state of the cell.</p>

<p><a name="gene-regulatory-network"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisageneregulatorynetwork">What is a gene regulatory network?</h3>

<p>Genes exert regulatory effects on each other: the expression of one gene
may increase or decrease the expression of another gene.</p>

<p>RNA sequencing, the basis for <a href="#transcriptomics">transcriptomics</a>, examines
a snapshot of the RNA content in a cell, which can infer regulatory
relationships.</p>

<p>A gene regulatory network expresses the regulatory dependence relationships
between genes.</p>

<p><a name="antibody"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisanantibody">What is an antibody?</h3>

<p>Within the immune system, an antibody is a kind of protein that is adapted
to recognize many different (presumably infectious) agents.</p>

<p>Antibodies have a Y-like structure, and the tips contain a region that can
be varied significantly to recognize a wide variety of molecules.</p>

<p>Once an antibody recognizes its target, it signals it for destruction (or
may actively disable the target on its own).</p>

<p>Some therapeutics are also based on developing custom antibodies to
recognize harmful agents.</p>

<p>In laboratory science, special antibodies are often developed to detect the
presence and quantity of particular agents.</p>

<p><a name="binding-affinity"></a></p>

<h3 id="whatisbindingaffinity">What is binding affinity?</h3>

<p>With respect to a given structure such as <a href="#DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="#domain-of-function">a domain on a
protein</a>, the binding affinity of another molecule is
the degree to which this secondary molecule is attracted.</p>

<p>Drug design often depends on optimizing binding affinity.</p>

<p><a name="identifying-an-expert"></a></p>

<h3 id="howdoifindtherightscientificexpert">How do I find the right scientific expert?</h3>

<p>One of the most challenging aspects of precision medicine from the patient
side is the identification of qualified and appropriate scientific
expertise.</p>

<p>The Weber Lab at Harvard has created search engines for expertise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/search/people">Harvard Catalyst Expert Search</a></p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://direct2experts.org/">Direct2Expert</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In standard medicine, patients expect to be able to work with a single
physician, but in precision medicine, each stage may require a different
physician or scientist.</p>

<p>Evaluating the quality and fit of a potential scientific partner may also be
challenging for non-academics.</p>

<p>Questions to answer when considering the fit of a scientist include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Does the scientist have publications that relate to the genes, models or
mechanisms of interest?</p></li>
<li><p> Does the scientist have research funding already aligned with genes,
models or mechanisms of interest?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If funding a scientist, it is important to request a plan that explains and
justifies both the basic and translational scope of research efforts.</p>
